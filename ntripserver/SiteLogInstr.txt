Instructions for filling out IGS site logs
1 Dec 2003 (added Height Diff to Ant instructions)

See log form at ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/station/general/blank.log

General
=======

Please prepare site logs in plain ASCII.

Line length is limited to 80 characters.

See http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/network/sitelog-submissions.html for
submission instructions, or email your log to igscb.jpl.nasa.gov if 
you prefer.  Site logs emailed manually are usually handled by
the CB within about one business day.

Date and time formats are ISO 8061; see http://www.iso.ch/markete/8601.pdf
As a summary, CC=2 digit century
              YY=2 digit year
              MM=2 digit month
              DD=2 digit day of month
              T=date/time separator
              hh=2 digit hour
              mm=2 digit minutes of hour
              Z=UTC indicator
              /=separator when begin & end times are given

Latitude/Longitude formats are aligned to ISO 6709:
  Lat:  +/-DDMMSS.SS
  Long: +/-DDDMMSS.SS
A + or - sign is required.  Leading zeroes must be used as appropriate
to maintain the DDMMSS and DDDMMSS format.

"etc" indicates you may enter any relevant answer, not just a choice 
ofthe suggestions shown.

"F7.4," "A4" and so on indicate the  FORTRAN-style format which the 
response should have.
     Example     12345.7 = F7.1
                    ABCD = A4

Blocks which have a "N.x" definition (namely sections 3-10) should 
always have the complete historic set of information; when a change is 
made, the previous information is left (for example in section 3.1) 
and the new information is placed in a new block numbered 3.2.  Please 
leave the .x  sections uncompleted to remind yourself of the format 
when the next change occurs.  

Please remove the response hints  such as "(F7.4 N/S)" as you fill out 
the log (except in the .x sections and Date Removed fields for 
currently installed equipment, which you will leave).  If an
answer in an optional field is unknown, try to learn the answer for 
the next log update.  

If you have any questions not answered here, please feel free to 
contact the IGS Central Bureau:igscb@igscb.jpl.nasa.gov

Special Instructions  by section
================================

0.   Form
-----------

If Update:
Previous Site Log       : (ssss_CCYYMMDD.log)
     If the site already has a log at the IGS Central Bureau, enter 
     the filename currently found under 
     ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/station/log/     
     ssss = 4 character site name

If Update:
Modified/Added Sections : (n.n,n.n,...)
     Enter the sections which have changed from the previous version 
     of the  log.  Example: 3.2, 4.2

1.   Site Identification of the GNSS Monument
---------------------------------------------

IERS DOMES Number        : (A9)
     This is strictly required.  See 
     http://lareg.ensg.ign.fr/ITRF/domesreq.html to obtain one.

Monument Description     : (PILLAR/BRASS PLATE/STEEL MAST/FICTIVE/etc)
     Enter one or more elements as necessary to describe the monument.

Additional Information   : (multiple lines)
     Suggestions: electrical isolation

2. Site Location Information
-----------------------------

Approximate Position (ITRF)
     This should be to a one meter precision.  The elevation is to be
given as an F7.1 number representing an ellipsoidal height.
     
3.  GNSS Receiver Information
--------------------------------------

Receiver Type            : (A20, from rcvr_ant.tab; see instructions)
     Please find your receiver in 
     ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/station/general/rcvr_ant.tab and use 
     the official name, taking care to get capital letters, hyphens, 
     etc. exactly correct.  If you do not find a listing for your 
     receiver, please notify the IGS Central Bureau 
     (igscb@igscb.jpl.nasa.gov).

Serial Number            : (A20)
     Keep the 5 significant characters of the serial number field in 
     SINEX in mind: do not enter "S/N 12345" instead of "12345" since 
     valuable information will be lost.

Firmware Version         : (A11)
     Keep the 11 significant characters of the field in SINEX in mind.

 Elevation Cutoff Setting : (deg)
     Please respond with the tracking cutoff as set in the receiver, 
     regardless of terrain or obstructions in the area.

Temperature Stabiliz.    : (none or tolerance in degrees C.)
     This refers to the temperature of the room in which the receiver 
     is housed.

Date Removed             : (CCYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ)
     In the block for the receiver currently in operation, leave this 
     line as is to remind yourselt of the format when the next receiver 
     change is made.

4.   GNSS Antenna Information
---------------------------------------

Antenna Type             : (A20 from rcvr_ant.tab; see instructions)
     Please find your antenna in 
     ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/station/general/rcvr_ant.tab and 
     use the official name, taking care to get capital letters, hyphens, 
     etc. exactly correct.  If you do not find a listing for your 
     antenna, please notify the IGS Central Bureau 
     (igscb@igscb.jpl.nasa.gov).  Please do not use antenna names from a 
     "Previously valid" section.  Choose the corresponding new antenna 
     name.  You may indicate a Radome code from rcvr_ant.tab in columns 
     17-20 of the Antenna Type if desired.

Serial Number            : (A20)
     Keep the 5 significant characters of the serial number field in 
     SINEX in mind: do not enter "S/N 12345" instead of "12345" since 
     valuable information will be lost.

Antenna Reference Point  : (BPA/BCR/XXX from "antenna.gra"; see instructions)
     Locate your antenna in the file 
     ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/station/general/antenna.gra 
     Indicate the three-letter abbreviation for the point which is 
     indicated equivalent to ARP for your antenna.  Contact the Central 
     Bureau (igscb@igscb.jpl.nasa.gov) if your antenna does not appear.

Marker->ARP Up Ecc. (m)  : (F8.4) 
     This is the antenna height measured to an accuracy of 1mm 
     and defined as the vertical distance of the ARP from the marker 
     described in section 1.

Alignment from True N    : (deg; + is clockwise/east)
     The positive direction is clockwise, so that due east
     would be equivalent to a response of "+90"

Antenna Radome Type      : (A4 from rcvr_ant.tab; see instructions)
     Place a Radome code from
     ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/station/general/rcvr_ant.tab here.  
     "NONE" indicates there is no radome.

Date Removed             : (CCYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ)
     In the block for the antenna currently in operation, leave this 
     line as is to remind yourselt of the format when the next antenna 
     change is made.

8. Meterological Information
-------------------------------------------------------------
       Height Diff to Ant     : (m)
This is sensor height minus antenna height.  In other words, positive
if the sensor is above the antenna.  Please note that this convention
was used in the Notes.

12.  Responsible Agency (if different from 9.)
-------------------------------------------------------------
The primary contacts listed here should always be the first choice for 
questions about operation of the site.  This person will receive 
automated emails regarding site log or RINEX errors and should be 
someone who can answer  questions about the configuration and data 
delivery for this site.

13.  More Information
-------------------------------------------------------------
     Primary Data Center      :
     Secondary Data Center    :
Please list the DC where the station's data ordinarily goes first as
"Primary."  Use "Secondary" either for a second location where
the station's data always goes, or would go in the case of a
failure with the Primary DC.
