<p><h3>1. <a name="genInstruction">General Information</h3></p>
<p>
The BKG Ntrip Client (BNC) is a program for simultaneously retrieving, decoding, converting and processing or analyzing real-time GNSS data streams applying the 'Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol' (Ntrip) standard. It has been developed within the framework of the IAG sub-commission for Europe (EUREF) and the International GNSS Service (IGS). Although meant as a real-time tool, it comes with some Post Processing functionality. You may like to use it for data coming from Ntrip Broadcasters like

<p>
BNC has been written under GNU General Public License (GPL). Source code is available from Subversion software archive <u>http://software.rtcm-ntrip.org/svn/trunk/BNC.</u> Binaries for BNC are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X systems. We used the MinGW Version 4.4.0 compiler to create the Windows binaries. It is likely that BNC can be compiled on other systems where a GNU compiler and Qt Version 4.8.4 or any later version are installed. Please ensure that you always use the latest precompiled version of BNC available from <u>http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/download</u>. Note that static and shared builds of BNC are made available. A <u>static</u> build would be sufficient in case you don't want BNC to trace PPP results using Google Map (GM) or OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, GM/OSM usage requires the QtWebKit library which can only be part of BNC builds from <u>shared</u> libraries. Using a shared library BNC build requires that you first install your own shared Qt library. The 'README.txt' file which comes with the BNC source code describes how to install Qt on Windows, Linux and Mac systems.

<p><h4>1.1 <a name="introPurpose">Purpose</h4></p>

<p>
Promoting Open RTCM Standards for streaming GNSS data over the Internet has been a major aspect in developing BNC as Open Source real-time software. Basically, the tool enables the test, validation and further evolution of new RTCM messages for precise satellite navigation. With high-level source code at hand, it also allows university education to catch up with comprehensive state-of-the-art positioning and potentially contribute fresh ideas which are free from any licensing.
</p>

<p> BNC was designed to serve the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>Retrieve real-time GNSS data streams available through Ntrip transport protocol;</li>
<li>Retrieve real-time GNSS data streams via TCP directly from an IP address without using the Ntrip transport protocol;</li>
<li>Retrieve real-time GNSS data streams from a local UDP or serial port without using the Ntrip transport protocol;</li>
<li>Plot stream distribution map from Ntrip Broadcaster source-tables;</li>
<li>Generate RINEX Observation and Navigation files to support near real-time GNSS Post Processing applications;</li>
<li>Edit or concatenate RINEX files or carry out RINEX Quality Checks (QC);</li>
<li>Convert RINEX Version 2 to RINEX Version 3 and vice versa;</li>
<li>Compare SP3 files containing satellite orbit and clock data;</li>
<li>Generate orbit and clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris through an IP port to</li>
<ul>
<li>support real-time Precise Point Positioning on GNSS rovers;</li>
<li>support the (outside) combination of such streams as coming simultaneously from various correction providers;</li>
</ul>
<li>Generate ephemeris and synchronized or unsynchronized observations epoch by epoch through an IP port to support real-time GNSS network engines;</li>
<li>Feed a stream into a GNSS receiver via serial communication link;</li>
<li>Monitor the performance of a network of real-time GNSS data streams to generate advisory notes in case of outages or corrupted streams;</li>
<li>Scan RTCM streams for incoming antenna information, observation types, message types and repetition rates and latencies and GLONASS slot numbers and frequency channels;</li>
<li>Carry out real-time Precise Point Positioning to determine GNSS rover positions;</li>
<li>Enable multi-station Precise Point Positioning for simultaneous processing of observations from a whole network of receivers;</li>
<li>Plot positions derived via PPP from RTCM streams or RINEX files on maps from Google Map or OpenStreetMap;</li>
<li>Simultaneously process several Broadcast Correction streams to produce, encode and upload combined Broadcast Corrections;</li>

<li>Estimate real-time tropospheric zenith path delays and save them in SINEX troposphere file format;</li>

<li>Read GNSS orbits and clocks in a plain ASCII format from an IP port. They can be produced by a real-time GNSS engine such as RTNET and should be referenced to the IGS Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) reference system. BNC will then</li>
<ul>
<li>Convert the IGS Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed orbits and clocks into Broadcast Corrections with radial, along-track and cross-track components;</li>
<li>Upload Broadcast Corrections as an RTCM Version 3 stream to an Ntrip Broadcaster;</li>
<li>Refer the orbit and clock corrections to a specific reference system;</li>
<li>Log the Broadcast Corrections as Clock RINEX files for further processing using other tools than BNC;</li>
<li>Log the Broadcast Corrections as SP3 files for further processing using other tools than BNC;</li>
</ul>
<li>Upload a Broadcast Ephemeris stream in RTCM Version 3 format;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
BNC supports the following GNSS stream formats and message types:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>RTCM Version 2 message types; </li>
<li>RTCM Version 3 'conventional' message types;</li>
<li>RTCM Version 3 message types for Broadcast Ephemeris;</li>
<li>RTCM Version 3 'State Space Representation' (SSR) messages;</li>
<li>RTCM Version 3 'Multiple Signal Messages' (MSM) and 'High Precision Multiple Signal Messages' (HP MSM);</li>
<li>RTNET, a plain ASCII format defined within BNC to receive orbits and clocks from a serving GNSS engine.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
BNC supports the following GNSS file formats:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>RINEX Version 2.11 & 3.03, Receiver Independent Exchange format for observations, navigation and meteorological data;</li>
<li>SINEX Version 2.10, Solution Independent Exchange format for station position and velocity solutions;</li>
<li>SINEX TRO, Troposphere Solution Independent Exchange format for zenith path delay products;</li>
<li>SP3 Version c format for orbit solutions;</li>
<li>Clock RINEX Version 3.02 format for station and satellite clock solutions;</li>
<li>ANTEX Version 1.4, Antenna Exchange format for antenna phase center variations;</li>
<li>NMEA Version 0813, National Marine Electronics Association format for satellite navigation data;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Note that BNC allows to by-pass decoding and conversion algorithms for incoming streams, leave whatever is received untouched to save it in files or output it through local TCP/IP port.
</p>

<p><h4>1.2 <a name="introSystem">Supported Systems</h4></p>
<p>
BNC is permanently completed to finally support all existing GNSS systems throughout all features of the program. The table below shows in detail which GNSS systems are so far supported by particular applications when using the latest BNC version. Application areas named here are:
<ul>
<li>Decoding of RTCM or RTNET streams</li>
<li>RINEX and SP3 file input and output</li>
<li>Encoding of SSR and ephemeris messages</li>
<li>Upload of SSR and ephemeris messages</li>
<li>PPP (Precise Point Positioning)</li>
<li>Combining/merging SSR or ephemeris messages from various real-time sources</li>
</ul>
The table mentions if a message implementation in BNC could so far only be based on a 'RTCM Proposal'.

<p><h4>1.3 <a name="introFlow">Data Flow</h4></p>

<p>
BNC can be used in different contexts with varying data flows. Typical real-time communication follows the Ntrip protocol over TCP/IP (probably via SSL), RTSP/RTP or UDP, plain TCP/IP protocol, or serial communication links. Stream contents could be observations, ephemeris, satellite orbit/clock products or NMEA sentences.
</p>
<p>
 The first of the following figures shows a flow chart of BNC connected to a GNSS receiver providing observations via serial or TCP communication link for the purpose of Precise Point Positioning. The second figure shows the conversion of RTCM streams to RINEX files. The third figure shows a flow chart of BNC feeding a real-time GNSS engine which estimates precise orbits and clocks. BNC is used in this scenario to encode correctors to RTCM Version 3 and upload them to an Ntrip Broadcaster. The fourth figure shows BNC combining several Broadcast Correction streams to disseminate the combination product while saving results in SP3 and Clock RINEX files.

<p><u>Figure 4:</u> Flowchart, BNC combining Broadcast Correction streams.</p>

<p><h4>1.4 <a name="introHandling">Handling</h4></p>
<p>
Although BNC is mainly a real-time tool to be operated online, it can be run offline
<ul>
<li>To simulate real-time observation situations for debugging purposes;</li>
<li>For Post Processing purposes.</li>
</ul>
Furthermore, apart from its regular window mode, BNC can be run as a batch/background job in a 'no window' mode using processing options from a previously saved configuration or from command line.
</p>
<p>
Unless it runs offline, BNC
</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires access to the Internet with a minimum of about 2 to 6 kbits/sec per stream depending on the stream format and the number of visible satellites. You need to make sure that the connection can sustain the required bandwidth;</li>
<li>Requires the clock of the host computer to be properly synchronized;</li>
<li>Has the capacity to retrieve hundreds of GNSS data streams simultaneously. Please be aware that such usage may incur a heavy load on the Ntrip Broadcaster side depending on the number of streams requested. We recommend limiting the number of streams where possible to avoid unnecessary workload.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The main window of BNC shows a 'Top menu bar' section, a 'Settings' sections with panels to set processing options, a 'Streams' section, a section for 'Log' tabs, and a 'Bottom menu bar' section, see figure below.
</p>
<p><img src="IMG/screenshot09.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 5:</u> Sections on BNC's main window.</p>

<p>
Running BNC in interactive mode requires graphics support. This is also
required in batch mode when producing plots. Windows and Mac OS X systems always
support graphics. However, when using BNC in batch mode on Linux systems for
producing plots, you need to make sure that at least a virtual X-Server like
'Xvfb' is installed and the '-display' command-line option is used.
</p>

<p>
The usual handling of BNC is that you first select a number of streams ('Add Stream'). Any stream configured to BNC shows up on the 'Streams' canvas in the middle of BNC's main window. You then go through BNC's various configuration panels to set a combination of input, processing and output options before you start the program ('Start'). Most configuration panels are dedicated to a certain functionality of BNC. If the first option field on such a configuration panel is empty, the affected functionality is deactivated.
</p>

<p>
Records of BNC's activities are shown in the 'Log' tab which is part of the 'Log' canvas. The bandwidth consumption per stream, the latency of incoming observations and a PPP time series for coordinate displacements are also part of that canvas and shown in the 'Throughput', 'Latency' and 'PPP Plot' tabs.
</p>

<p><h4>1.5 <a name="introConf">Configuration</h4></p>
<p>
The following sections present information on how the BNC configuration works and provide configuration examples which can be adjusted according to specific user needs.
</p>

<p><h4>1.5.1 <a name="introManage">Management</h4></p>
<p>
As a default, configuration files for running BNC on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X systems are saved in directory '${HOME}/.config/BKG'. On Windows systems, they are typically saved in directory 'C:/Documents and Settings/Username/.config/BKG'. The default configuration filename is 'BNC.bnc'.</p>
<p>
The default filename 'BNC.bnc' can be changed and the file contents can easily be edited. On graphical user interfaces it is possible to Drag &amp; Drop a configuration file icon to start BNC (not on Mac OS X systems). It is also possible to start and configure BNC via command line. Some configuration options can be changed on-the-fly. See annexed 'Command Line Help' for a complete set of configuration options. 
</p>

<p>
BNC maintains configuration options at three different levels:
</p>

<ol type=b>
<li>GUI, input fields level</li>
<li>Active configuration level</li>
<li>Configuration file, disk level</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot31.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 6:</u> Management of configuration options in BNC:<br>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>Left:</td><td>BNC in graphics mode; active configuration options are introduced through GUI input fields and finally saved on disk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>Middle:</td><td>BNC in 'no window' mode; active configuration options are read from disk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>Right:</td><td>BNC in 'no window' mode without configuration file; default configuration options can be replaced via command line options.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Configuration options are usually specified using GUI input fields (1) after launching BNC. When hitting the 'Start' button, configuration options are transferred one level down to become BNC's active configuration (2), allowing the program to begin its operation. Pushing the 'Stop' button ends data processing so that the user can finally terminate BNC through 'File'->'Quit'->'Save Options' which saves processing options in a configuration file to disk (3). It is important to understand that:
<ul>
<li>Active configuration options (2) are independent from GUI input fields and configuration file contents.</li>
<li>Hence changing configuration options at GUI level (1) while BNC is already processing data does not influence a running job.</li>
<li>Editing configuration options at disk level (3) while BNC is already processing data does also not influence a running job. However, there are two exceptions which force BNC to update certain active options on-the-fly:</li>
<ul>
<li>Pushing the 'Reread & Save Configuration' button lets BNC immediately reread its configuration from GUI input fields to make them active configuration options. Then BNC saves them on disk.</li>
<li>Specifying the 'Reread configuration' option lets BNC reread its configuration from disk at pre-defined intervals.</li>
</ul>
<li>A specific BNC configuration can be started in 'no window' mode from scratch without a configuration file if options for the active configuration level (2) are provided via command line.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4>1.5.2 <a name="introExamples">Examples</h4></p>

<p>
BNC comes with a number of configuration examples which can be used on all operating systems. Copy the complete directory 'Example_Configs' which comes with the software including sub-directories 'Input' and 'Output' to your disc. There are several ways to start BNC using one of the example configurations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On graphical systems (except for Mac systems) you may use the computer mouse to 'drag' a configuration file icon and 'drop' it on top of BNC's program icon.
</li>
<li>
You could also start BNC using a command line for naming a specific configuration file (suggested e.g. for Mac systems):<br>
bnc --conf &lt;configFileName&gt;
</li>
<li>
On non-graphical systems or when running BNC in batch mode in the background you may start the program using a command line with a configuration file option in '<u>n</u>o <u>w</u>indow' mode (example for Windows systems):<br>
bnc.exe --conf &lt;configFileName&gt; --nw
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although it's not a must, we suggest that you always create BNC configuration files with the filename extension '.bnc'.
</p>

<p>
We furthermore suggest for convenience reasons that you configure your system to automatically start BNC when you double-click a file with the filename extension '.bnc'. The following describes what to do on Windows systems to associate the BNC program to such configuration files:
</p>

<ol type=b>
<li>Right-click a file that has the extension '.bnc' and then click 'Open'. If the 'Open' command is not available, click 'Open With' or double-click the file.</li>
<li>Windows displays a dialog box that says that the system cannot open this file. The dialog box offers several options for selecting a program.</li>
<li>Click 'Select the program from a list', and then click 'OK'.</li>
<li>The 'Open With' dialog box is displayed. Click 'Browse', locate and then click the BNC program, and then click 'Open'.</li>
<li>Click to select the 'Always use the selected program to open this kind of file' check box.</li>
<li>Click 'OK'.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some of the presented example configuration files contain a user ID 'Example' with a password 'Configs' for accessing a few GNSS streams from public Ntrip Broadcasters. This generic account is arranged for convenience reasons only. Please be so kind as to replace the generic account details as well as the place holders 'User' and 'Pass' by the personal user ID and password you receive following an online registration through <u>http://register.rtcm-ntrip.org</u>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the account for an Ntrip Broadcaster is usually limited to pulling a specified maximum number of streams at the same time. As running some of the example configurations requires pulling several streams, it is suggested to make sure that you don't exceed your account's limits.
</p>

<p>
Make also sure that sub-directories 'Input' and 'Output' which are part of the example configurations exist on your system or adjust the affected example configuration options according to your needs.
</p>

<p>
Some BNC options require antenna phase center variations as made available from IGS through so-called ANTEX files at <u>ftp://igs.org/pub/station/general</u>. An example ANTEX file 'igs08.atx' is part of the BNC package for convenience.
</p>

<p>
The example configurations assume that no proxy protects your BNC host. Should a proxy be operated in front of BNC then you need to introduce its name or IP and port number in the 'Network' panel.
</p>

<p>
You should be able to run all configuration examples without changing their options. However, configurations 'Upload.bnc' and 'UploadPPP.bnc' are exceptions because they require an input stream from a connected network engine.
</p>
<ol type=b>

<li>File 'RinexObs.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is showing how to convert RTCM streams to 
RINEX Observation files. The configuration pulls streams from Ntrip 
Broadcasters using Ntrip Version 1 to generate 15min 1Hz RINEX Version 3 
Observation files. See http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/observations for observation 
stream resources. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'RinexEph.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is showing how to convert a RTCM stream 
carrying navigation messages to a RINEX Navigation file. The configuration 
pulls a RTCM Version 3 stream with Broadcast Ephemeris coming from the 
real-time EUREF and IGS networks. It saves hourly RINEX Version 3 Navigation 
files. See http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/ephemeris for further real-time 
Broadcast Ephemeris resources. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'BrdcCorr.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to save Broadcast Corrections from RTCM 
SSR messages in a plain ASCII format as hourly files. See 
http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/orbits for further real-time IGS or EUREF 
orbit/clock products. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'RinexConcat.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to concatenate RINEX Version 3 files to 
produce a concatenated file and edit the marker name in the file header. The 
sampling interval is set to 30 seconds. See section 'RINEX Editing & QC' in the 
documentation for examples on how to call BNC from command line in 'no window' 
mode for RINEX file editing, concatenation and quality checks. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'RinexQC.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to check the quality of a RINEX Version 3 
file through a multipath analysis. Results are saved on disk in terms of a 
plot in PNG format. See section 'RINEX Editing & QC' in the documentation for 
examples on how to call BNC from command line in 'no window' mode for RINEX 
file editing, concatenation and quality checks. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'RTK.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to feed a serial connected receiver with 
observations from a reference station for conventional RTK. The stream is 
scanned for RTCM messages. Message type numbers and latencies of incoming 
observation are reported in BNC's logfile. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'FeedEngine.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to feed a real-time GNSS engine with 
observations from remote reference stations. The configuration pulls a single 
stream from an Ntrip Broadcaster. It would of course be possible to pull 
several streams from different casters. Incoming observations are decoded, 
synchronized and output through a local IP port and saved into a file. Failure 
and recovery thresholds are specified to inform about outages. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'PPP.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is Precise Point Positioning from 
observations of a rover receiver. The configuration reads RTCM Version 3 
observations, a Broadcast Ephemeris stream and a stream with Broadcast 
Corrections. Positions are saved in the logfile. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'PPPNet.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to demonstrate simultaneous Precise 
Point Positioning for several rovers or several receivers from a network of 
reference stations in one BNC job. The possible maximum number of PPP solutions 
per job depends on the processing power of the hosting computer. This example 
configuration reads two RTCM Version 3 observation streams, a Broadcast 
Ephemeris stream and a stream with Broadcast Corrections. PPP Results for the 
two stations are saved in PPP logfiles. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'PPPQuickStart.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is Precise Point Positioning in Quick-Start 
mode from observations of a static receiver with precisely known position. The 
configuration reads RTCM Version 3 observations, Broadcast Corrections and a 
Broadcast Ephemeris stream. Positions are saved in NMEA format on disc. 
Positions are also output through IP port for real-time visualization with 
tools like RTKPLOT. Positions are also saved in the logfile. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'PPPPostProc.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is Precise Point Positioning in Post 
Processing mode. BNC reads RINEX Version 3 Observation and 3 Navigation files 
and a Broadcast Corrections file. PPP processing options are set to support 
the Quick-Start mode. The output is saved in a specific Post Processing 
logfile and contains coordinates derived over time following the 
implemented PPP filter algorithm. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'PPPGoogleMaps.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to track BNC's point positioning
solution using Google Maps or OpenStreetMap as background. BNC reads a
RINEX Observation file and a RINEX Navigation file to carry out a
'Standard Point Positioning' solution in post processing mode. Although 
this is not a real-time application it requires the BNC host to be connected
to the Internet. Specify a computation speed, then hit button 'Open Map'
to open the track map, then hit 'Start' to visualize receiver positions
on top of GM/OSM maps.
</li><br>

<li>File 'SPPQuickStartGal.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is Single Point Positioning in Quick-Start 
mode from observations of a static receiver with precisely known position. The 
configuration uses GPS, GLONASS and Galileo observations and a Broadcast 
Ephemeris stream. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'SaveSp3.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to produce SP3 files from a Broadcast 
Ephemeris stream and a Broadcast Corrections stream. The Broadcast Corrections 
stream is formally introduced in BNC's 'Combine Corrections' table. Note that 
producing SP3 requires an ANTEX file because SP3 file contents should be 
referred to CoM. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'Sp3ETRF2000PPP.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to produce SP3 files from a Broadcast 
Ephemeris stream and a stream carrying ETRF2000 Broadcast Corrections. The 
Broadcast Corrections stream is formally introduced in BNC's 'Combine 
Corrections' table. This leads to an SP3 file containing orbits referred also 
to ETRF2000. Pulling in addition observations from a reference station at 
precisely known ETRF2000 position allows comparing an 'INTERNAL' PPP solution 
with ETRF2000 reference coordinates. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'Upload.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to upload orbits and clocks from a 
real-time GNSS engine to an Ntrip Broadcaster. For that the configuration reads 
precise orbits and clocks in RTNET format. It also reads a stream carrying 
Broadcast Ephemeris. BNC converts the orbits and clocks into Broadcast 
Corrections and encodes them in RTCM Version 3 SSR messages to upload them to 
an Ntrip Broadcaster. The Broadcast Corrections stream is referred to satellite 
Antenna Phase Center (APC) and IGS08. Orbits are saved on disk in SP3 format 
and clocks in Clock RINEX format. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'Combi.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to pull several streams carrying Broadcast 
Corrections and a Broadcast Ephemeris stream from an Ntrip Broadcaster to 
produce a combined Broadcast Corrections stream. BNC encodes the combination 
product in RTCM Version 3 SSR messages and uploads that to an Ntrip 
Broadcaster. The Broadcast Corrections stream is not referred to satellite 
Center of Mass (CoM). It is referred to IGS08. Orbits are saved in SP3 format 
and clocks in Clock RINEX format. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'CombiPPP.bnc'<br>
This configuration equals the 'Combi.bnc' configuration. However, the combined 
Broadcast Corrections are in addition used for an 'INTERNAL' PPP solutions 
based on observations from a static reference station with known precise 
coordinates. This allows a continuous quality check of the combination product 
through observing coordinate displacements. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'UploadEph.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to pull a number of streams from reference 
stations to get hold of contained Broadcast Ephemeris messages. These are 
encoded then in a RTCM Version 3 stream which only provides Broadcast Ephemeris 
with an update rate of 5 seconds. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'CompareSp3.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this configuration is to compare two SP3 files to calculate 
RMS values for orbit and clock differences. GPS satellite G05 and GLONASS 
satellite R18 are excluded from this comparison. Comparison results are saved 
in a logfile. 
</li><br>

<li>File 'Empty.bnc'<br>
The purpose of this example is to provide an empty configuration file for BNC
which only contains the default settings.
</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p><h4>1.6 <a name="introLimit">Limitations</h4></p>
<ul>
<li>
In Qt-based desktop environments (like KDE) on Unix/Linux platforms it may happen that you experience a crash of BNC at startup even when running the program in the background using the '-nw' option. This is a known bug most likely resulting from an incompatibility of Qt libraries in the environment and in BNC. Entering the command 'unset SESSION_MANAGER' before running BNC may help as a work-around.
</li>

<li>
Using RTCM Version 3 to produce RINEX files, BNC will properly handle most message types. However, when handling message types 1001, 1003, 1009 and 1011 where the ambiguity field is not set, the output will be no valid RINEX. All values will be stored modulo 299792.458 (speed of light).
</li>
<li>
Using RTCM Version 2, BNC will only handle message types 18 and 19 or 20 and 21 together with position and the antenna offset information carried in types 3 and 22. Note that processing carrier phase corrections and pseudo-range corrections contained in message types 20 and 21 needs access to Broadcast Ephemeris. Hence, whenever dealing with message types 20 and 21, make sure that Broadcast Ephemeris become available for BNC through also retrieving at least one RTCM Version 3 stream carrying message types 1019 (GPS ephemeris) and 1020 (GLONASS ephemeris).
</li>
<li>
BNC's 'Get Table' function only shows the STR records of a source-table. You can use an Internet browser to download the full source-table contents of any Ntrip Broadcaster by simply entering its URL in the form of <u>http://host:port</u>. Data field number 8 in the NET records may provide information about where to register for an Ntrip Broadcaster account.
</li>
<li>
EUREF as well as IGS adhere to an open data policy. Streams are made available through Ntrip Broadcasters at <u>www.euref-ip.net</u>, <u>www.igs-ip.net</u>, <u>products.igs-ip.net</u>, and <u>mgex.igs-ip.net</u> free of charge to anyone for any purpose. There is no indication up until now how many users will need to be supported simultaneously. The given situation may develop in such a way that it might become difficult to serve all registered users at the same times. In cases where limited resources on the Ntrip Broadcaster side (software restrictions, bandwidth limitation etc.) dictates, first priority in stream provision will be given to stream providers followed by re-broadcasting activities and real-time analysis centers while access to others might be temporarily denied.

<p><h4>1.7 <a name="introLBack">Looking Back</h4></p>
<p>
A basic function of BNC is streaming GNSS data over the open Internet using the Ntrip transport protocol. Employing IP streaming for satellite positioning goes back to the beginning of our century. Wolfgang Rupprecht has been the first who developed TCP/IP server software under the acronym of DGPS-IP (Rupprecht 2000) and published it under GNU General Public License (GPL). While connecting marine beacon receivers to PCs with permanent access to the Internet he transmitted DGPS corrections in RTCM format to support Differential GPS positioning over North America. With approximately 200 bits/sec the bandwidth requirement for disseminating beacon data was comparatively small. Each stream was transmitted over a unique combination of IP address and port. Websites informed about existing streams and corresponding receiver positions.
</p>
<p>
To cope with an increasing number of transmitting GNSS reference stations, the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG) together with the Informatik Centrum Dortmund (ICD) in Germany developed a streaming protocol for satellite navigation data called 'Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol' (Ntrip). The protocol was built on top of the HTTP standard and included the provision of meta data describing the stream contents. Any stream could now be globally transmitted over just one IP port: HTTP port 80. Stream availability and content details became part of the transport protocol. The concept was first published in 2003 (Weber et al. 2003) and based on three software components, namely an NtripServer pushing data from a reference station to an NtripCaster and an NtripClient pulling data from the stream splitting caster to support a rover receiver. (Note that from a socket-programmers perspective NtripServer and NtripClient both act as clients; only the NtripCaster operates as socket-server.) Ntrip could essentially benefit from Internet Radio developments. It was the ICECAST multimedia server which provided the bases for BKG's 'Professional Ntrip Broadcaster' with software published first in 2003 and of course again as Open Source under GPL.
</p>
<p>
For BKG as a governmental agency, making Ntrip an Open Industry Standard has been an objective from the very beginning. The 'Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services' (RTCM) accepted 'Ntrip Version 1' in 2004 as 'RTCM Recommended Standard' (Weber et al. 2005). Nowadays there is almost no geodetic GNSS receiver which does not come with integrated NtripClient and NtripServer functionality as part of the firmware. Hundreds of NtripCaster implementations are operated world-wide for highly accurate satellite navigation through RTK networks. Thousands of reference stations upload observations via NtripServer to central computing facilities for any kind of NtripClient application. In 2011 'Ntrip Version 2' was released (RTCM SC-104 2011) which cleared and fixed some design problems and HTTP protocol violations. It also supports TCP/IP via SSL and adds optional communication over RTSP/RTP and UDP.
</p>
<p>
With the advent of Ntrip as open streaming standard, BKG's interest turned towards taking advantage from free real-time access to GNSS observations. NGOs such as the IAG Reference Frame Sub Commissions for Africa (AFREF), Asia & Pacific (APREF), Europe (EUREF), North America (NAREF) Latin America & Caribbean (SIRGAS), and the International GNSS Service (IGS) maintain continental or even global GNSS networks with the majority of modern receivers supporting Ntrip stream upload. Through operating BKG's NtripCaster software, these networks became extremely valuable sources of real-time GNSS information.  In 2005 this was the starting point for developing the 'BKG Ntrip Client' (BNC) as a multi-stream Open Source NtripClient which allows pulling hundreds of streams simultaneously from any number of NtripCaster installations world-wide. Decoding incoming RTCM streams and output observations epoch by epoch through IP port to feed a real-time GNSS network engine became BNC's first and foremost ability. Converting decoded streams to short high-rate RINEX files to assist near real-time applications became a welcome by-product right from the start of this development.
</p>
<p>
Adding real-time Precise Point Positioning (PPP) support to BNC began in 2010 as an important completion in view of developing an Open RTCM Standard for that. According to the State Space Representation (SSR) model, new Version 3 messages are proposed to provide e.g. satellite orbit and clock corrections and ionospheric corrections as well as biases for code and phase data. The ultimate goal for SSR standardization is to reach centimeter level accuracy within seconds as an alternative to Network RTK methods like VRS, FKP, and MAC. Because of interoperability aspects, an Open Standard in this area is of particular interest for clients. Regarding stand-alone PPP in BNC it is worth mentioning that the program is not and can never be in competition with a receiver manufacturer's proprietary solution. Only software or services which are part of a receiver firmware could have the potential of becoming a thread for commercial interests. However, implementing or not implementing an Open PPP approach in a firmware is and always remains a manufacturer's decision.
</p>
<p>
Implementing some post processing capability is essential for debugging real-time software in case of problems. So certain real-time options in BNC were complemented to work offline through reading data from files. Moreover, beginning in 2012 the software was extended to support Galileo, BeiDou, and QZSS besides GPS and GLONASS. With that the Open Source tool BNC could be used for RINEX Version 3 file editing, concatenation and quality checks, a post processing functionality demanded by the IGS Multi-GNSS Experiment and not really covered at that time by UNAVCO's famous TEQC program with its limitation on GPS.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, the BNC Subversion (SVN) software archive received over seven thousand commits made by 11 contributors representing about one hundred thirty thousand lines of code. The well established, mature codebase is mostly written in C++ language. Its publication under GNU GPL is thought to be well-suited for test, validation and demonstration of new approaches in precise real-time satellite navigation when IP streaming is involved. Commissioned by a German governmental agency, the overall intention has been to push the development of RTCM Recommended Standards to the benefit of IAG institutions and services such as IGS and the interested public in general.

<p><h3>2. <a name="optsettings">Settings Details</h3></p>
<p>
The following chapters describe how to set BNC program options. They explain the 'Top Menu Bar', the 'Settings Canvas' with the processing options, the contents of the 'Streams Canvas' and 'Logging Canvas', and the 'Bottom Menu Bar'.
</p>
<p>

<p><h4>2.1 <a name="topmenu">Top Menu Bar</h4></p>
<p>
The top menu bar allows selecting a font for the BNC windows, save configured options, or quit the program execution. It also provides access to the program's documentation.
</p>

<p><h4>2.1.1 <a name="file">File</h4></p>

<p>
The 'File' button lets you
<ul>
<li> Select an appropriate font.<br>
Use smaller font size if the BNC main window exceeds the size of your screen.
</li>
<li> Reread and save selected options in configuration file.<br>
When using 'Reread &amp; Save Configuration' while BNC is already processing data, some configuration options become immediately effective on-the-fly without interrupting uninvolved threads while all of them are saved on disk. See section 'Reread Configuration' for a list of on-the-fly changeable configuration options.
</li>
<li> Quit the BNC program.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4>2.1.2 <a name="help">Help</h4></p>

<p>
The 'Help' button provides access to
<ul>
<li>
Help contents.<br>
You may keep the 'Help Contents' window open while configuring BNC.
</li>
<li>
A 'Flow Chart' showing BNC linked to a real-time GNSS network engine such as RTNET.
</li>
<li>
General information about BNC.<br>
Close the 'About BNC' window to continue working with BNC.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4>2.2 <a name="network">Network</h4></p>
<p>
You may need to specify a proxy when running BNC in a protected network. You may also like to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols for secure Ntrip communication over the Internet.
</p>
<p><h4>2.2.1 <a name="proxy">Proxy - Usage in a protected LAN</h4></p>
<p>
If you are running BNC within a protected Local Area Network (LAN), you might need to use a proxy server to access the Internet. Enter your proxy server IP and port number in case one is operated in front of BNC. If you don't know the IP and port of your proxy server, check the proxy server settings in your Internet browser or ask your network administrator.</p>
<p>
Note that IP streaming is often not allowed in a LAN. In this case you need to ask your network administrator for an appropriate modification of the local security policy or for the installation of a TCP relay to the Ntrip Broadcasters. If these are not possible, you might need to run BNC outside your LAN on a host that has unobstructed connection to the Internet.
</p>

<p><h4>2.2.2 <a name="ssl">SSL - Transport Layer Security</h4></p>
<p>Communication with an Ntrip Broadcaster over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as well as the download of RINEX skeleton files when available from HTTPS websites requires the exchange of client and/or server certificates. Specify the path to a directory where you save certificates on your system. You may like to check out <u>http://software.rtcm-ntrip.org/wiki/Certificates</u> for a list of known Ntrip Server certificates. You may also just try communication via SSL to check out whether this is supported by the involved Ntrip Broadcaster. </p>
<p>SSL communication may involve queries coming from the Ntrip Broadcaster or from a HTTPS website hosting RINEX skeletons. Such a query could show up under BNC's 'Log' tab as follows:
<pre>
   SSL Error
   Server Certificate Issued by:
   GNSS Data Center
   BKG (Bundesamt f&uuml;r Geod&auml;sie und Kartographie)
   Cannot be verified

   The issuer certificate of a locally looked up certificate could not be found
   The root CA certificate is not trusted for this purpose
   No certificates could be verified
</pre>
Tick 'Ignore SSL authorization errors' if you generally trust the server and don't want to be bothered with this. Note that SSL communication is usually done over port 443.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot40.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 7:</u> BNC's 'Network' panel configured to ignore eventually occurring SSL error messages.</p>

<p><h4>2.3 <a name="general">General</h4></p>
<p>
The following defines general settings for BNC's logfile, file handling, reconfiguration on-the-fly, and auto-start.
</p>

<p><h4>2.3.1 <a name="genlog">Logfile - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Records of BNC's activities are shown in the 'Log' tab on the bottom of the main window. These logs can be saved into a file when a valid path is specified in the 'Logfile (full path)' field. The logfile name will automatically be extended by a string '_YYMMDD' carrying the current date. This leads to series of daily logfiles when running BNC continuously for extended. Message logs cover the communication status between BNC and the Ntrip Broadcaster as well as problems that may occur in the communication link, stream availability, stream delay, stream conversion etc. All times are given in UTC. The default value for 'Logfile (full path)' is an empty option field, meaning that BNC logs will not be saved into a file.
</p>
<p>
The following is an example for the contents of a logfile written by BNC when operated in Single Point Positioning (SPP) mode:

</pre>

<p><h4>2.3.2 <a name="genapp">Append Files - optional</h4></p>
<p>
When BNC is started, new files are created by default and any existing files with the same name will be overwritten. However, users might want to append existing files following a restart of BNC, a system crash or when BNC crashed. Tick 'Append files' to continue with existing files and keep what has been recorded so far. Note that option 'Append files' affects all types of files created by BNC.
</p>

<p><h4>2.3.3 <a name="genconf">Reread Configuration - optional</h4></p>
<p>
When operating BNC online in 'no window' mode (command line option -nw), some configuration options can nevertheless be changed on-the-fly without interrupting the running process. For that you force the program to reread parts of its configuration in pre-defined intervals from the disk. Select '1 min', '1 hour', or '1 day' to let BNC reread on-the-fly changeable configuration options every full minute, hour, or day. This lets in between edited options become effective without interrupting uninvolved threads. 
</p>

<p>
Note that the following configuration options saved on disk can be changed/edited on-the-fly while BNC is already processing data:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>'mountPoints' to change the selection of streams to be processed, see section 'Streams';</li>
<li>'outWait' to change the 'Wait for full obs epoch' option, see section 'Feed Engine';</li>
<li>'outSampl' to change the 'Sampling' option, see section 'Feed Engine'.</li>
<li>'outFile' to change the 'File' name where synchronized observations are saved in plain ASCII format.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
</p>

<p><h4>2.3.4 <a name="genstart">Auto Start - optional</h4></p>
<p>
You may like to auto-start BNC at startup time in window mode with pre-assigned configuration options. This may be required i.e. immediately after booting your system. Tick 'Auto start' to supersede the usage of the 'Start' button. Make sure that you maintain a link to BNC for that in your Autostart directory (Windows systems) or call BNC in a script below directory /etc/init.d (Unix/Linux/Mac OS X systems).
</p>
<p>
See BNC's command line option '-nw' for an auto-start of BNC in 'no window' mode.
</p>

<p><h4>2.3.5 <a name="rawout">Raw Output File - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can save all data coming in through various streams in one daily file. The information is recorded in the specified 'Raw output file' in the received order and format. This feature allows a BNC user to run the PPP option offline with observations, Broadcast Corrections, and Broadcast Ephemeris being read from a previously saved file. It supports the offline repetition of a real-time situation for debugging purposes and it is not meant for Post Processing.
</p>
<p>
Data will be saved in blocks in the received format separated by ASCII time stamps like (example):
<pre>
   2010-08-03T18:05:28 RTCM3EPH RTCM_3 67
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This example block header tells you that 67 bytes were saved in the data block following this time stamp. The information in this block is encoded in RTCM Version 3 format, comes from mountpoint RTCM3EPH and was received at 18:05:29 UTC on 2010-08-03. BNC adds its own time stamps in order to allow the reconstruction of a recorded real-time situation.
</p>
<p>
The default value for 'Raw output file' is an empty option field, meaning that BNC will not save all raw data into one single daily file.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4 <a name="rinex">RINEX Observations</h4></p>
<p>
Observations will be converted to RINEX if they come in either RTCM Version 2 or RTCM Version 3 format. Depending on the RINEX version and incoming RTCM message types, files generated by BNC may contain data from GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, SBAS, QZSS and/or BDS (BeiDou). In case an observation type is listed in the RINEX header but the corresponding observation is unavailable, its value is set to zero '0.000' or left blank. Note that the 'RINEX TYPE' field in the RINEX Version 3 Observation file header is always set to 'M(MIXED)' or 'Mixed' even if the file only contains data from one system.
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that converting RTCM streams to RINEX files requires a priori information on observation types for specifying a complete RINEX header. Regarding the RINEX Version 2 file header, BNC simply introduces all observation types defined in the Version 2 standard and later reports "0.000" for all observations which are not received. However, following this approach is not possible for RINEX Version 3 files from RTCM Version 3 MSM streams because of the huge number of observation types which might in principle show up. The solution implemented in BNC is to start with RINEX Version 3 observation type records from skeleton files (see section 'Skeleton Extension' and 'Skeleton Mandatory') and switch to a default selection of observation types when such skeleton file is not available or does not contain the required information. The following is the default selection of observation types specified for a RINEX Version 3 file:
</p>
<pre>
C    8 C1  C1P L1  S1  C2  C2P L2  S2                       SYS / # / OBS TYPES
E    8 C1  C1P L1  S1  C2  C2P L2  S2                       SYS / # / OBS TYPES
G    8 C1  C1W L1  S1  C2  C2W L2  S2                       SYS / # / OBS TYPES
J    8 C1  C1P L1  S1  C2  C2P L2  S2                       SYS / # / OBS TYPES
R    8 C1  C1P L1  S1  C2  C2P L2  S2                       SYS / # / OBS TYPES
S    8 C1  C1P L1  S1  C2  C2P L2  S2                       SYS / # / OBS TYPES
</pre>

<p>
Please note that RTCM Version 3 messages 1084 for GLONASS observations don't contain the channel numbers. However, these messages can only be converted to RINEX when you add messages which include the channel numbers. This could be done though an additional stream carrying 1087 GLONASS observation messages or an additional stream carrying 1020 GLONASS ephemeris messages. You could also consider setting up a streams which contains both, the 1084 and the 1020 messages.
</p>
<p>
The screenshot below shows an example setup of BNC when converting streams to RINEX. Streams are coming from various Ntrip Broadcasters as well as from a serial communication link. Specifying a decoder string 'ZERO' means to not convert the affected stream but save its contents as received. The 'SSL Error' recorded in the 'Log' tab is caused by the fact that observation stream downloads from IGS and MGEX Broadcasters initiate the download of RINEX skeleton files from a HTTPS (TLS/SSL) website and BNC has been configured in this example to ignore SSL errors as shown in the preceding 'Network' panel screenshot.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot16.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 8:</u> BNC translating incoming observation streams to 15 min RINEX Version 3 Observation files.</p>

<p><h4>2.4.1 <a name="rnxname">RINEX Filenames</h4></p>
<p>
The default for RINEX filenames in BNC follows the convention of RINEX Version 2. However, the software provides options to alternatively follow the filename convention of RINEX Version 3. RINEX Version 2 filenames are derived by BNC from the first 4 characters of the corresponding stream's mountpoint (4Char Station ID). For example, data from mountpoints FRANKFURT and WETTZELL will have hourly RINEX Observation files named</p>

<pre>
   FRAN{ddd}{h}.{yy}O
   WETT{ddd}{h}.{yy}O
</pre>
<p>
where 'ddd' is the day of year, 'h' is a letter which corresponds to an hour long UTC time block and 'yy' is the year.
</p>
<p>
If there is more than one stream with identical 4Char Station ID (same first 4 characters for their mountpoints), the mountpoint strings are split into two sub-strings and both become part of the RINEX filename. For example, when simultaneously retrieving data from mountpoints FRANKFURT and FRANCE, their hourly RINEX Version 2 Observation files are named as</p>
<pre>
   FRAN{ddd}{h}_KFURT.{yy}O
   FRAN{ddd}{h}_CE.{yy}O
</pre>
<p>
If several streams show exactly the same mountpoint name (example: BRUS0 from <u>www.euref-ip.net</u> and BRUS0 from <u>www.igs-ip.net</u>), BNC adds an integer number to the filename leading i.e. to hourly RINEX Version 2 Observation files like</p>
<pre>
   BRUS{ddd}{h}_0.{yy}O
   BRUS{ddd}{h}_1.{yy}O
</pre>
<p>
Note that RINEX Version 2 filenames for all intervals less than 1 hour follow the filename convention for 15 minutes RINEX Version 2 Observation files i.e.</p>
<pre>
   FRAN{ddd}{h}{mm}.{yy}O
</pre>
<p>
where 'mm' is the starting minute within the hour.
</p>

<p>
In case of RINEX Version 3 filenames, the following convention holds:

<p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Parameter</b></td><td><b>&nbsp; # Char.</b></td><td><b>&nbsp; Meaning</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Name</td><td>&nbsp; 9</td><td>&nbsp; Site, station and country code</td></tr>
<tr><td>S</td><td>&nbsp; 1</td><td>&nbsp; Data source</td></tr>
<tr><td>Start Time</td><td>&nbsp; 11</td><td>&nbsp; YYYYDDDHHMM</td></tr>
<tr><td>Period</td><td>&nbsp; 3</td><td>&nbsp; File period</td></tr>
<tr><td>Obs. Freq.</td><td>&nbsp; 3</td><td>&nbsp; Observation frequency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Content</td><td>&nbsp; 2</td><td>&nbsp; Content type</td></tr>
<tr><td>Format</td><td>&nbsp; 3</td><td>&nbsp; File format</td></tr>
<tr><td>Compression</td><td>&nbsp; 2-3</td><td>&nbsp; Compression method (optional)</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
Example for Mixed RINEX Version 3 GNSS observation filename, file containing 1 hour of data, one observation every second, 'MO' standing for 'Mixed Observations':
<pre>
   ALGO00CAN_R_20121601000_01H_01S_MO.rnx
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Note that filename details are produced from the streams mountpoint as well as corresponding BNC settings and meta data from the Ntrip Broadcaster source-table.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.2 <a name="rnxdir">Directory - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Here you can specify the path to where the RINEX Observation files will be stored. If the specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create RINEX Observation files. Default value for 'Directory' is an empty option field, meaning that no RINEX Observation files will be written.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.3 <a name="rnxinterval">File Interval - mandatory if 'Directory' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the length of the RINEX Observation file generated. The default value is 15 minutes.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.4 <a name="rnxsample">Sampling - mandatory if 'Directory' is set </h4></p>
<p>
Select the RINEX Observation sampling interval in seconds. A value of zero '0' tells BNC to store all received epochs into RINEX. This is the default value.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.5 <a name="rnxskl">Skeleton Extension - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Whenever BNC starts generating RINEX Observation files (and then once every day at midnight), it first tries to retrieve information needed for RINEX headers from so-called public RINEX header skeleton files which are derived from sitelogs. A HTTP or HTTPS link to a directory containing these skeleton files may be available through data field number 7 of the affected NET record in the source-table. See <u>http://www.epncb.oma.be:80/stations/log/skl/brus.skl</u> for an example of a public RINEX header skeleton file for EPN station Brussels. Note that the download of RINEX skeleton files from HTTPS websites requires the exchange of client and/or server certificates. Clarify 'SSL' options offered through panel 'Network' for details.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes public RINEX header skeleton files are not available, their contents is not up to date, or you need to put additional/optional records in the RINEX header. For that BNC allows using personal skeleton files that contain the header records you would like to include. You can derive a personal RINEX header skeleton file from the information given in an up to date sitelog. A file in the RINEX Observations 'Directory' with a 'Skeleton extension' suffix is interpreted by BNC as a personal RINEX header skeleton file for the corresponding stream.
</p>
<p>
When producing RINEX Observation files from mountpoints (examples) 'BRUS0', 'FRANKFURT'; and 'WETTZELL' the following skeleton filenames would be accepted
</p>
<pre>
   BRUS.skl
   FRAN.skl
   WETT.skl
</pre>
<p>
if 'Skeleton extension' is set to 'skl'.
</p>
<p>
Note the following regulations regarding personal RINEX header skeleton files:
<ul>
<li>If such a file exists in the 'RINEX directory', the corresponding public RINEX header skeleton file is ignored. The RINEX header is generated solely from the contents of the personal skeleton.</li>
<li>Personal skeletons should contain a complete first header record of type
<br>- &nbsp; RINEX VERSION / TYPE<br></li>
<li>They should then contain an empty header record of type
<br>- &nbsp; PGM / RUN BY / DATE<br>
BNC will complete this line and include it in the RINEX file header.</li>
<li>They should further contain complete header records of type
<br>- &nbsp; MARKER NAME
<br>- &nbsp; OBSERVER / AGENCY
<br>- &nbsp; REC # / TYPE / VERS
<br>- &nbsp; ANT # / TYPE
<br>- &nbsp; APPROX POSITION XYZ
<br>- &nbsp; ANTENNA: DELTA H/E/N
<br>- &nbsp; WAVELENGTH FACT L1/2 (RINEX Version 2)
<br>- &nbsp; SYS / # / OBS TYPES (for RINEX Version 3 files, will be ignored when writing Version 2 files)</li>
<li>They may contain any other optional complete header record as defined in the RINEX documentation.</li>
<li>They should also contain an empty header records of type
<br>- &nbsp; # / TYPES OF OBSERV (only RINEX Version 2, will be ignored when writing RINEX Version 3 files)
<br>BNC will include these lines in the final RINEX file header together with an additional
<br>- &nbsp; COMMENT
<br>line describing the source of the stream.</li>
<li>They should finally contain an empty header record of type
<br>- &nbsp; END OF HEADER (last record)</li>

<li>They must not contain a header record of type
<br>- &nbsp; TIME OF FIRST OBS</li>

</ul>
<p>
If neither a public nor a personal RINEX header skeleton file is available for BNC, a default header will be used.

<p>

<p><h4>2.4.6 <a name="sklMandat">Skeleton Mandatory - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Tick check box 'Skeleton mandatory' in case you want that RINEX files are only produced if skeleton files are available for BNC. If no skeleton file is available for a particular source then no RINEX observation file will be produced from the affected stream.
</p>
<p>Note that a skeleton file contains RINEX header information such as receiver and antenna types. In case of stream conversion to RINEX Version 3 a skeleton file should also contain information on potentially available observation types. A missing skeleton file will therefore enforce BNC to only save a default set of RINEX 3 observation types.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.7 <a name="rnxscript">Script - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Whenever a RINEX Observation file is saved, you might want to compress, copy or upload it immediately via FTP. BNC allows you to execute a script/batch file to carry out these operations. To do that, specify the full path of the script/batch file here. BNC will pass the RINEX Observation file path to the script as a command line parameter (%1 on Windows systems, $1 on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X systems).
</p>
<p>
The triggering event for calling the script or batch file is the end of a RINEX Observation file 'Interval'. If that is overridden by a stream outage, the triggering event is the stream reconnection.
</p>
<p>
As an alternative to initiating file uploads through BNC, you may like to call an upload script or batch file through your crontable or Task Scheduler (independent from BNC) once every one or two minutes after the end of each RINEX file 'Interval'.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.8 <a name="rnxvers2">Version 2 - optional</h4></p>
<p>
GNSS observation data are generally hold available within BNC according to attributes as defined in RINEX Version 3. These attributes describe the tracking mode or channel when generating the observation signals. Capital letters specifying signal generation attributes are A, B, C, D, I, L, M, N, P, Q, S, W, X, Y, and Z, see RINEX Version 3 documentation. Although RINEX Version 3 with its signal generation attributes is the internal default processing format for BNC, there are two applications where the program is explicitly required to produce data in RINEX Version 2 format: 
<ol type=1>
<li>When saving the contents of incoming observation streams in RINEX Version 2 files as described in this section.</li>
<li>When editing or concatenating RINEX 3 files to save them in Version 2 format, see section on 'RINEX Editing & QC'.</li>
</ol>
As the Version 2 format ignores signal generation attributes, BNC is forced to somehow map RINEX Version 3 to RINEX Version 2 although this can't be done in one-to-one correspondence. Hence we introduce a 'Signal priority' list of attributes (characters, forming a string) for mapping Version 3 to Version 2.
</p>
<p>
The default 'Signal priority' list is an empty option string meaning a priority sequence of 'CWPX_?' attributes when mapping RINEX 3 to RINEX 2. The meaning of this sequence of characters - take it as an example - is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Signals with attribute 'C' enjoy the highest priority. If such a Version 3 observation becomes available it is presented as RINEX Version 2 observation if that is the format you wish to see. Observations with other attributes are ignored.</li>
<li>If no signal with 'C' attribute is available but we have an observation with 'W' attribute, BNC presents that one as RINEX Version 2 observation and ignores all observations with other attributes. The same applies mutatis mutandis to observations with P and X attributes.</li>
<li>If no signal with 'C', 'W', 'P', or 'X' attribute is available but a signal with undefined generation attribute (underscore character, '_') exists, BNC presents that one as RINEX Version 2 observation. Note that observation attributes should actually always be available in RINEX Version 3. Hence the underscore character makes only sense in a few very special cases.</li>
<li>If no signal with 'C', 'W', 'P', 'X', or '_' generation attribute exists then the question mark '?' tells BNC to present the first of any other appearing signal as RINEX Version 2 observation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Signal priorities can be specified either as equal for all systems or system specific. The following are example priority strings:</li>
<ul>
<li>CWPX_? (Same signal priorities valid for all systems)</li>
<li>G:CWPX_? R:PCX_? E:CPX_? (Specific signal priorities for GPS, GLONASS and Galileo system)</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
You may like to specify you own 'Signal priority' string(s) for producing RINEX Version 2 files. If you neither convert observation streams to RINEX Version 2 nor concatenate RINEX Version 3 to Version 2 files then the 'Version 2' option is meaningless.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.9 <a name="rnxvers3">Version 3 - optional</h4></p>
<p>
The default format for RINEX Observation files is RINEX Version 2.11. Select RINEX 'Version 3' if you would like to save RTCM Version 3 observation streams in RINEX Version 3 format.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is possible to force a RTCM Version 2 stream to be saved in RINEX Version 3 file format. However, this is not recommended because such stream cannot be precisely mapped to RINEX Version 3 as the required information on tracking modes (observation attributes) is not part of RTCM Version 2.
</p>

<p><h4>2.4.10 <a name="rnxvers3File">Version 3 Filenames - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Tick check box 'Version 3 filenames' to let BNC create so-called extended filenames following the RINEX Version 3 standard.
</p>
<p>Default is an empty check box, meaning to still use filenames following the RINEX Version 2 standard although the file contents is saved in RINEX Version 3 format.
</p>

<p><h4>2.5 <a name="ephemeris">RINEX Ephemeris</h4></p>
<p>
Broadcast Ephemeris can be saved as RINEX Navigation files when received via RTCM Version 3 e.g. as message types 1019 (GPS) or 1020 (GLONASS) or 1044 (QZSS) or 1043 (SBAS) or 1045 and 1046 (Galileo) or 63 (tentative, BDS/BeiDou). The filename convention follows the details given in section 'RINEX Filenames' except that the first four characters are 'BRDC'.
</p>
<p>
For RINEX Version 2 Navigation files the last character is 'N' or 'G' for GPS or GLONASS ephemeris in two separate files.
</p>
<p>
Regarding RINEX Version 3 you will find all ephemeris data for GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, SBAS, QZSS, and BDS saved together in one Navigation file.
</p>
<p>
The following is an example for a RINEX Version 3 Navigation filename. The file contains one days data. 'MN' stands for 'Multi Constellation Navigation' data.
<pre>
   BRDC00DEU_S_20121600000_01D_MN.rnx
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Note that streams dedicated to carry Broadcast Ephemeris messages in RTCM Version 3 format in high repetition rates are listed on <u>http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/ephemeris</u>.
</p>

<p>
Note further that BNC will ignore incorrect or outdated Broadcast Ephemeris data when necessary, leaving a note 'WRONG EPHEMERIS' or 'OUTDATED EPHEMERIS' in the logfile.
</p>

<p><h4>2.5.1 <a name="ephdir">Directory - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Specify a path for saving Broadcast Ephemeris data as RINEX Navigation files. If the specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create RINEX Navigation files. Default value for Ephemeris 'Directory' is an empty option field, meaning that no RINEX Navigation files will be created.
</p>

<p><h4>2.5.2 <a name="ephint">Interval - mandatory if 'Directory' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the length of RINEX Navigation files. The default value is '1 day'.
</p>

<p><h4>2.5.3 <a name="ephport">Port - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can output Broadcast Ephemeris in RINEX Version 3 format on your local host (IP 127.0.0.1) through an IP 'Port'. Specify an IP port number to activate this function. The default is an empty option field, meaning that no ASCII ephemeris output via IP port is generated.
</p>
<p>
The source code for BNC comes with an example Perl script 'test_tcpip_client.pl' that allows you to read BNC's ASCII ephemeris output from the IP port.
</p>

<p><h4>2.5.4 <a name="ephvers">Version - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Default format for RINEX Navigation files containing Broadcast Ephemeris is RINEX Version 2.11. Select 'Version 3' if you want to save the ephemeris data in RINEX Version 3 format.
</p>
<p>
Note that this does not concern the Broadcast Ephemeris output through IP port which is always in RINEX Version 3 format.
</p>

<p><h4>2.5.5 <a name="ephversFile">Version 3 Filenames - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Tick check box 'Version 3 filenames' to let BNC create so-called extended filenames following the RINEX Version 3 standard.
</p>
<p>Default is an empty check box, meaning to still use filenames following the RINEX Version 2 standard although the file contents is saved in RINEX Version 3 format.
</p>

<p><h4>2.6 <a name="reqc">RINEX Editing & QC</h4></p>
<p>
Besides stream conversion from RTCM to RINEX, BNC allows editing RINEX files or concatenate their contents. RINEX Observation and Navigation files can be handled. BNC can also carry out a RINEX file Quality Check. In summary  and besides Stream <u><b>T</b></u>ranslation this functionality in BNC covers
<ul>
<li>File <u><b>E</b></u>diting and concatenation</li>
<li>File <u><b>Q</b></u>uality <u><b>C</b></u>heck</li>
<ul>
<li>Multipath analysis sky plots</li>
<li>Signal-to-noise ratio sky plots</li>
<li>Satellite availability plots</li>
<li>Satellite elevation plots</li>
<li>PDOP plots</li>
</ul>
</ul>
and hence follows UNAVCO's famous TEQC program (see Estey and Meertens 1999). The remarkable thing about BNC in this context is that it supports RINEX Version 3 under GNU General Public License with full GUI support and instant graphics output.
</p>

<p><h4>2.6.1 <a name="reqcact">Action - optional</h4></p>
<p>Select an action. Options are 'Edit/Concatenate' and 'Analyze'.
<ul>
<li>Select 'Edit/Concatenate' if you want to edit RINEX file contents according to options specified under 'Set Edit Options' or if you want to concatenate several RINEX files.</li>
<li>Select 'Analyze' if you are interested in a quality check of your RINEX file contents.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4>2.6.2 <a name="reqcinp">Input Files - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Specify full path to input RINEX Observation file(s), and<br>
specify full path to input RINEX Navigation file(s).
</p>
<p>
When specifying several input files BNC will concatenate their contents. In case of RINEX Observation input files with different observation type header records, BNC will output only one specific set of adjusted observation type records in the RINEX header which fits to the whole file contents.
</p>
<p>
Note that you may specify several RINEX Version 2 Navigation files for GPS and GLONASS. 
</p>

<p><h4>2.6.3 <a name="reqcout">Output Files - optional if 'Action' is set to 'Edit/Concatenate'</h4></p>
<p>
If 'Edit/Concatenate' is selected, specifying the full path to output RINEX Observation file(s) and specifying the full path to output RINEX Navigation file(s) is optional. Default are empty option fields, meaning that no RINEX files will be saved on disk.
</p>

<p><h4>2.6.4 <a name="reqclog">Logfile - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Specify the name of a logfile to save information on RINEX file Editing/Concatenation or Analysis. Default is an empty option field, meaning that no logfile will be saved.
</p>

<p>
Note that logfiles from analyzing RINEX files may become quite large. Hence BNC provides an option 'Summary only' to limit this logfile contents to some essential information in case 'Action' is set to 'Analyze'. The following is an example for a RINEX quality check analysis logfile:

Note that in addition to cycle slips recorded in the RINEX 'file', cycle slips identified by BNC are reported as 'found'.
</p>

<p><h4>2.6.5 <a name="reqcplots">Plots for Signals - mandatory if 'Action' is set to 'Analyze'</h4></p>
<p>
Multipath and signal-to-noise sky plots as well as plots for satellite availability, elevation and PDOP are produced per GNSS system and frequency with the multipath analysis based on CnC observation types (n = band / frequency). The 'Plots for signals' option lets you exactly specify the observation signals to be used for that and also enables the plot production. You can specify the navigation system (C = BDS, E = Galileo, G = GPS, J = QZSS, R = GLONASS, S = SBAS), the frequency, and the tracking mode or channel as defined in RINEX Version 3. Specifications for frequency and tracking mode or channel must be separated by ampersand character '&'. Specifications for each navigation systems must be separated by blank character ' '. The following string is an example for option field 'Plots of signals': It lets you exactly specify the observation signals to be used and also enables the plot generation. You can specify the navigation system, the frequency, and the tracking mode or channel as defined in RINEX Version 3. Specifications for frequency and tracking mode or channel must be separated by ampersand character '&'. Specifications for each navigation systems must be separated by blank character ' '.
<br>
<pre>
   C:2&7 E:1&5 G:1&2 J:1&2 R:1&2 S:1&5
</pre>
This default configuration will present:
<ul>
<li>BDS plots for L2 and L7,</li>
<li>Galileo plots for L1 and L5,</li>
<li>GPS plots for L1 and L2,</li>
<li>QZSS plots for L1 and L2,</li>
<li>GLONASS plots for L1 and L2,</li>
<li>SBAS plots for L1 and L5.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4>2.6.6 <a name="reqcdir">Directory for Plots - optional if 'Action' is set to 'Analyze'</h4></p>
<p>
If 'Analyze' is selected, specifying the path to a directory where plot files will be saved is optional. Filenames will be composed from the RINEX input filename(s) plus suffix 'PNG' to indicate the plot file format in use. Default is an empty option field, meaning that plots will not be saved on disk.
</p>

<p><h4>2.6.7 <a name="reqcedit">Set Edit Options - mandatory if 'Action' is set to 'Edit/Concatenate'</h4></p>
<p>Once the 'Edit/Concatenate' action is selected, you have to 'Set Edit Options'. BNC lets you specify the RINEX version, a signal priority list when mapping RINEX Version 3 to Version 2, the sampling interval, begin and end of file, operator, observation types, comment lines, and marker, antenna, receiver details. Note that some of the specifications for editing and concatenation are only meaningful for RINEX Observation files but not for RINEX Navigation files.
</p>

<p>
A note on converting RINEX Version 3 to RINEX Version 2 and vice versa:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The RINEX Version 2 format ignores signal generation attributes. Therefore, when converting <u>RINEX Version 3 to Version 2</u> Observation files, BNC is forced to somehow map signals with attributes to signals without attributes although this can't be done in one-to-one correspondence. Hence we introduce a 'Version 2 Signal Priority' list of attributes (characters, forming a string) for mapping Version 3 to Version 2, see details in section 'RINEX Observations/Version 2'. The default 'Version 2 Signal Priority' list of observation attributes when mapping RINEX Version 3 to Version 2 is 'CWPX_?'. Signal priorities can be specified either as equal for all systems or system specifics. The following are example priority strings:</li>
<ul>
<li>CWPX_? (Same signal priorities valid for all systems)</li>
<li>G:CWPX_? R:PCX_? E:CPX_? (Specific signal priorities for GPS, GLONASS and Galileo system)</li><br>
</ul>
<li>When converting <u>RINEX Version 2 to Version 3</u> Observation files, the tracking mode or channel information in the (last character out of the three characters) observation code is left blank if unknown. This is a compromise, knowing that it is not in accordance with the RINEX Version 3 documentation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Optionally you may specify a 'RUN BY' string to be included in the emerging new RINEX file header. Default is an empty option field, meaning the operator's ID is automatically used as 'RUN BY' string.
</p>

<p>
You can specify a list of observation codes in field 'Use Obs. Types' to limit the output file contents to specific observation codes. GNSS system characters in that list are followed by a colon and a two or three characters observation code. A two characters observation code would mean that all available tracking modes of the affected observation type and frequency will be accepted as part of the RINEX output file. Observation codes are separated by a blank character. Default is an empty option field, meaning that any input observation code will become part of the RINEX output file. 
</p>

<p>
Specifying comment line text to be added to the emerging new RINEX file header is another option. Any introduction of a newline through '\n' in this enforces the beginning of a further comment line. Comment line(s) will be added to the header immediately after the 'PGM / RUN BY / DATE' record. Default is an empty option field, meaning that no additional comment line will be added to the RINEX header.
</p>

<p>
If you specify a 'New' but no 'Old' marker/antenna/receiver name, the corresponding data field in the emerging new RINEX Observation file will be filled accordingly. If you in addition specify an 'Old' marker/antenna/receiver name, the corresponding data field in the emerging new RINEX Observation file will only be filled accordingly where 'Old' specifications match existing file contents.

<p><h4>2.6.8 <a name="reqccommand">Command Line, No Window - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC applies options from the configuration file but allows updating every one of them on the command line while the contents of the configuration file remains unchanged, see section on 'Command Line Options'. Note the following syntax for Command Line Interface (CLI) options:
</p>
<pre>
   --key &lt;keyName&gt; &lt;keyValue&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Parameter &lt;keyName&gt; stands for the name of an option contained in the configuration file and &lt;keyValue&gt; stands for the value you want to assign to it. This functionality may be helpful in the 'RINEX Editing & QC' context when running BNC on a routine basis for maintaining a RINEX file archive.
</p>
The following example for a Linux platform calls BNC in 'no window' mode with a local configuration file 'rnx.conf' for concatenating four 15min RINEX files from station TLSE residing in the local directory to produce an hourly RINEX Version 3 file with 30 seconds sampling interval:
</p>
<pre>
   ./bnc --nw --conf rnx.conf --key reqcAction Edit/Concatenate --key reqcObsFile 
   "tlse119b00.12o,tlse119b15.12o,tlse119b30.12o,tlse119b45.12o" --key 
   reqcOutObsFile tlse119b.12o --key reqcRnxVersion 3 --key reqcSampling 30
</pre>
<p>
You may use asterisk '*' and/or question mark '?' wildcard characters as shown with the following globbing command line option to specify a selection of files in a local directory:
<pre>
   --key reqcObsFile "tlse*"
or:
   --key reqcObsFile tlse\*
</pre>
</p>

<p>The following Linux command line produces RINEX QC plots (see Estey and Meertens 1999) offline in 'no window' mode and saves them in directory '/home/user'. Introducing a dummy configuration file /dev/null makes sure that no configuration options previously saved on disc are used:</p>
<pre>
   /home/user/bnc --conf /dev/null --key reqcAction Analyze --key reqcObsFile 
   CUT02070.12O --key reqcNavFile BRDC2070.12P --key reqcOutLogFile CUT0.txt --key
   reqcPlotDir /home/user --nw
</pre>
</p>
<p>The following Linux command line produces the same RINEX QC plots in interactive autoStart mode:
</p>
<pre>
   /home/user/bnc --conf /dev/null --key reqcAction Analyze --key reqcObsFile 
   CUT02070.12O --key reqcNavFile BRDC2070.12P --key reqcOutLogFile CUT0.txt --key
   --key startTab 4 --key autoStart 2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The following is a list of available key names for '<u>R</u>INEX <u>E</u>diting & <u>QC</u>' (short: REQC, pronounced 'rek') options and their meaning, cf. section 'Configuration Examples':

<p><h4>2.7 <a name="sp3comp">SP3 Comparison</h4></p>
<p>
BNC allows to compare the contents of two files containing GNSS orbit and clock data in SP3 format. SP3 ASCII files basically contain a list of records over a certain period of time. Each record carries a time tag, the XYZ position of the satellite's Center of Mass at that time and the corresponding satellite clock value. Both SP3 files may contain some records for different epochs. If so then BNC only compares records for identical epochs. BNC accepts that a specific GNSS system or a specific satellite is only available from one of the SP3 files. Note that BNC does not interpolate orbits when comparing SP3 files. 
</p>
<p>
To compare satellite clocks provided by the two files BNC first converts coordinate differences dX,dY,dZ into along track, out-of-plane and radial components. It then corrects the clock differences for the radial components of coordinate differences. RMS values of clock differences are finally calculated after introducing at first one offset 'per epoch for all satellites' and secondly one offset 'per satellite for all epochs'.

You may want to exclude one or more satellites in your SP3 files from the comparison. Or you may like to exclude all satellites of a specific GNSS system from the comparison. The following are example strings to be entered for excluding satellites from the comparison.
<ul>
<li>G05,G31 (excluding GPS satellites with PRN 5 and 31)</li>
<li>G (excluding all GPS satellites)</li>
<li>R (excluding all GLONASS satellites)</li>
<li>R12,R24 (excluding GLONASS satellites with slot number 12 and 24)</li>
<li>G04,G31,R (excluding GPS satellites with PRN 4 and 31 as well as all GLONASS satellites)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Default is an empty option field, meaning that no satellite will be excluded from the comparison.
</p>

<p><h4>2.8 <a name="correct">Broadcast Corrections</h4></p>
<p>
Differential GNSS and RTK operation using RTCM streams is currently based on corrections and/or raw measurements from single or multiple reference stations. This approach to differential positioning is using 'observation space' information. The representation with the RTCM standard can be called 'Observation Space Representation' (OSR).
</p>
<p>
An alternative to the observation space approach is the so called 'sate space' approach. The principle here is to provide information on individual error sources. It can be called 'State Space Representation' (SSR). For a rover position, state space information concerning precise satellite clocks, orbits, ionosphere, troposphere et cetera can be converted into observation space and used to correct the rover observables for more accurate positioning. Alternatively the state information can directly be used in the rover's processing or adjustment model.
</p>
<p>
RTCM is currently developing Version 3 messages to transport SSR corrections in real-time. They refer to satellite Antenna Phase Center (APC). SSR messages adopted or recently proposed concern:

<ul>
<li>SSR, Step I:</li>
<ul>
<li>Orbit corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris</li>
<li>Clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris</li>
<li>High-rate clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris</li>
<li>Combined orbit and clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris</li>
<li>User Range Accuracy (URA)</li>
<li>High Rate User Range Accuracy (HR URA)</li>
<li>Code biases</li>
</ul>
<li>SSR, Step II:</li>
<ul>
<li>Phase biases</li>
<li>Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
RTCM Version 3 streams carrying these messages may be used i.e. to support real-time Precise Point Positioning (PPP) applications.
</p>
<p>
When using clocks from Broadcast Ephemeris (with or without applied corrections) or clocks from SP3 files, it may be important to understand that they are not corrected for the conventional periodic relativistic effect. Chapter 10 of the IERS Conventions 2003 mentions that the conventional periodic relativistic correction to the satellite clock (to be added to the broadcast clock) is computed as dt =  -2 (R * V) / c^2 where R * V is the scalar product of the satellite position and velocity and c is the speed of light. This can also be found in the GPS Interface Specification, IS-GPS-200, Revision D, 7 March 2006.
</p>

<p>
Orbit corrections are provided in along-track, cross-track and radial components. These components are defined in the Earth-centered, Earth-fixed reference frame of the broadcast ephemerides. For an observer in this frame, the along-track component is aligned in both direction and sign with the velocity vector, the cross-track component is perpendicular to the plane defined by the satellite position and velocity vectors, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the along track and cross-track ones. The three components form a right-handed orthogonal system.
</p>

<p>
After applying corrections, the satellite position and clock is referred to the 'ionospheric free' phase center of the antenna which is compatible with the broadcast orbit reference.
</p>

<p>
The orbit and clock corrections do not include local effects like Ocean Loading, Solid Earth Tides or tropospheric delays. However, accurate single frequency applications can be correct for global ionospheric effects using so-call VTEC messages for global ionospheric state parameters.
</p>

<p>
While we have a plain ASCII standard for saving broadcast ephemeris in RINEX Navigation files, we don't have an equivalent standard for corrections to broadcast ephemeris. Hence BNC saves Broadcast Correction files following its own format definition. The filename convention for Broadcast Correction files follows the convention for RINEX Version 2 files except for the last character of the filename suffix which is set to 'C'.
</p>

<p>
BNC's Broadcast Correction files contain blocks of records in plain ASCII format. Each block covers information about one specific topic and starts with an 'Epoch Record'.
</p>
<p>
<b>The 'Epoch Record' of a Broadcast Corrections block</b>
</p>

<p>
The leading 'Epoch Record' of each block in a Broadcast Corrections file contains 11 parameters. Example:
</p>
<pre>
> ORBIT 2015 06 17 11 43 35.0 2 53 CLK93
</pre>
<p>
Their meaning is as follows:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Special character '&#62;' is the first character in each 'Epoch Record' (as we have it in RINEX Version 3)</li>
<li>SSR message or topic descriptor, valid descriptors are:<br>ORBIT, CLOCK, CODE_BIAS, PHASE_BIAS, or VTEC</li>
<li>Year, GPS time</li>
<li>Month, GPS time</li>
<li>Day, GPS time</li>
<li>Hour, GPS time</li>
<li>Minute, GPS time</li>
<li>Second, GPS time</li>
<li>SSR message update interval indicator</li>

<p><h4>2.8.1 <a name="corrdir">Directory, ASCII - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Specify a directory for saving Broadcast Corrections in files. If the specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create Broadcast Correction files. Default value for Broadcast Corrections 'Directory' is an empty option field, meaning that no Broadcast Correction files will be created.
</p>

<p><h4>2.8.2 <a name="corrint">Interval - mandatory if 'Directory, ASCII' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the length of the Broadcast Correction files. The default value is 1 day.
</p>

<p><h4>2.8.3 <a name="corrport">Port - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can output epoch by epoch synchronized Broadcast Corrections in ASCII format on your local host (IP 127.0.0.1) through an IP 'Port'. Specify an IP port number to activate this function. The default is an empty option field, meaning that no Broadcast Correction output via IP port is generated.
</p>
<p>
The output format is similar to the format used for saving Broadcast Corrections in a file.

<p>
The source code for BNC comes with an example Perl script 'test_tcpip_client.pl' that allows you to read BNC's Broadcast Corrections from the IP port.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot37.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 17:</u> BNC configuration example for pulling, saving and output of Broadcast Corrections.</p>

<p><h4>2.9 <a name="syncout">Feed Engine</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can generate synchronized or unsynchronized observations epoch by epoch from all stations and satellites to feed a real-time GNSS network engine. Observations can be streamed out through an IP port and/or saved in a local file. The output is always in plain ASCII format and sorted per incoming stream.
</p>
<p>
Any epoch in the output begins with a line containing the GPS week number and the seconds within the GPS week. Following lines begin with the mountpoint string of the stream which provides the observations followed by a satellite ID. Observation types are specified by the three character observation code defined in RINEX Version 3. In case of phase observations a Slip Count is added which is put to "-1" if it is not set. The end of an epoch in indicated by an empty line.
</p>

<p>Note on 'Slip Count':<br>
It is the current understanding of BNC's authors that different Slip Counts could be referred to different phase measurements (i.e. L1C and L1P). The 'loss-of-lock' flags in RINEX are an example for making such kind of information available per phase measurement. However, it looks like we do have only one Slip Count in RTCM Version 3 for all phase measurements. As it could be that a receiver generates different Slip Counts for different phase measurements, we output one Slip Count per phase measurement to a listening real-time GNSS network engine.
</p>

The following is an example for file and IP port output which presents observations from GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BDS (BeiDou), QZSS, and SBAS satellites as collected through streams WTZR0, CUT07, and COCO0:

</pre>
<p>
The source code for BNC comes with a Perl script named 'test_tcpip_client.pl' that allows you to read BNC's (synchronized or unsynchronized) ASCII observation output from the IP port and print it on standard output.
</p>

<p>
Note that any socket connection of an application to BNC's synchronized or unsynchronized observations ports is recorded in the 'Log' tab on the bottom of the main window together with a connection counter, resulting in log records like 'New client connection on sync/usync port: # 1'.
</p>

<p>
The following figure shows the screenshot of a BNC configuration where a number of streams is pulled from different Ntrip Broadcasters to feed a GNSS engine via IP port output.
</p>
<p><img src="IMG/screenshot12.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 18:</u> Synchronized BNC output via IP port to feed a GNSS real-time engine.</p>

<p><h4>2.9.1 <a name="syncport">Port - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can produce synchronized observations in ASCII format on your local host (IP 127.0.0.1) through an IP 'Port'. Synchronized means that BNC collects all observation data for any specific epoch which become available within a certain number of latency seconds (see 'Wait for Full Obs Epoch' option). It then - epoch by epoch - outputs whatever has been received. The output comes block wise per stream. Specify an IP port number here to activate this function. The default is an empty option field, meaning that no binary synchronized output is generated.</p>
</p>

<p><h4>2.9.2 <a name="syncwait">Wait for Full Obs Epoch - mandatory if 'Port' is set</h4></p>
<p>
When feeding a real-time GNSS network engine waiting for synchronized observations epoch by epoch, BNC drops whatever is received later than 'Wait for full obs epoch' seconds. A value of 3 to 5 seconds could be an appropriate choice for that, depending on the latency of the incoming streams and the delay acceptable for your real-time GNSS product. Default value for 'Wait for full obs epoch' is 5 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Note that 'Wait for full obs epoch' does not affect the RINEX Observation file content. Observations received later than 'Wait for full obs epoch' seconds will still be included in the RINEX Observation files.
</p>

<p><h4>2.9.3 <a name="syncsample">Sampling - mandatory if 'File' or 'Port' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the synchronized observation output sampling interval in seconds. A value of zero '0' tells BNC to send/store all received epochs. This is the default value.
</p>

<p><h4>2.9.4 <a name="syncfile">File - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Specify the full path to a 'File' where synchronized observations are saved in plain ASCII format. The default value is an empty option field, meaning that no ASCII output file is created.
</p>
<p>
Beware that the size of this file can rapidly increase depending on the number of incoming streams. The name of the file can be changed on-the-fly, to prevent it from becoming too large. This option is primarily meant for testing and evaluation.
</p>

<p><h4>2.9.5 <a name="syncuport">Port (unsynchronized) - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can produce unsynchronized observations from all configured streams in ASCII format on your local host (IP 127.0.0.1) through an IP 'Port'. Unsynchronized means that BNC immediately forwards any received observation to the port. Nevertheless, the output comes block wise per stream. Specify an IP port number here to activate this function. The default is an empty option field, meaning that no unsynchronized output is generated.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10 <a name="serial">Serial Output</h4></p>
<p>
You may use BNC to feed a serial connected device like a GNSS receiver. For that an incoming stream can be forwarded to a serial port. Depending on the stream contents the receiver may use it for Differential GNSS, Precise Point Positioning or any other purpose supported by its firmware.
</p>
<p>
Note that receiving a VRS stream requires the receiver sending NMEA sentences (mode 'Manual' or 'Auto') to the Ntrip Broadcaster. The following figure shows the data flow when pulling a VRS stream or a physical (none-VRS) stream.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot35.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 19:</u> Flowcharts, BNC forwarding a stream to a serial connected receiver; sending NMEA sentences is mandatory for VRS streams.</p>

<p>
The following figure shows the screenshot of an example situation where BNC pulls a VRS stream from an Ntrip Broadcaster to feed a serial connected RTK rover.
</p>

<p><u>Figure 20:</u> BNC pulling a VRS stream to feed a serial connected RTK rover.</p>

<p><h4>2.10.1 <a name="sermount">Mountpoint - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Enter a 'Mountpoint' to forward its corresponding stream to a serial connected GNSS receiver.
</p>
<p>
When selecting one of the serial communication options listed below, make sure that you pick those configured to the serial connected receiver.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.2 <a name="serport">Port Name - mandatory if 'Mountpoint' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Enter the serial 'Port name' selected on your host for communication with the serial connected receiver. Valid port names are
</p>
<pre>
   Windows:       COM1, COM2
   Linux:         /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1
   FreeBSD:       /dev/ttyd0, /dev/ttyd1
   Digital Unix:  /dev/tty01, /dev/tty02
   HP-UX:         /dev/tty1p0, /dev/tty2p0
   SGI/IRIX:      /dev/ttyf1, /dev/ttyf2
   SunOS/Solaris: /dev/ttya, /dev/ttyb
</pre>
<p>
Note that you must plug a serial cable in the port defined here before you start BNC.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.3 <a name="serbaud">Baud Rate - mandatory if 'Mountpoint' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select a 'Baud rate' for the serial output link. Note that using a high baud rate is recommended.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.4 <a name="serflow">Flow Control - mandatory if 'Mountpoint' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select a 'Flow control' for the serial output link. Note that your selection must equal the flow control configured to the serial connected device. Select 'OFF' if you don't know better.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.5 <a name="serparity">Parity - mandatory if 'Mountpoint' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the 'Parity' for the serial output link. Note that parity is often set to 'NONE'.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.6 <a name="serdata">Data Bits - mandatory if 'Mountpoint' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the number of 'Data bits' for the serial output link. Note that often '8' data bits are used.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.7 <a name="serstop">Stop Bits - mandatory if 'Mountpoint' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the number of 'Stop bits' for the serial output link. Note that often '1' stop bit is used.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.8 <a name="serauto">NMEA - mandatory if 'Mountpoint' is set</h4></p>
<p>The 'NMEA' option supports the so-called 'Virtual Reference Station' (VRS) concept which requires the receiver to send approximate position information to the Ntrip Broadcaster. Select 'no' if you don't want BNC to forward or upload any NMEA message to the Ntrip broadcaster in support of VRS.
</p>
<p>Select 'Auto' to automatically forward NMEA messages of type GGA from your serial connected receiver to the Ntrip broadcaster and/or save them in a file.
</p>
<p>Select 'Manual GPGGA' or 'Manual GNGGA' if you want BNC to produce and upload GPGGA or GNGGA NMEA messages to the Ntrip broadcaster because your serial connected receiver doesn't generate these messages. A Talker ID 'GP' preceding the GGA string stands for GPS solutions while a Talker ID 'GN' stands for multi constellation solutions.
</p>
<p>Note that selecting 'Auto' or 'Manual' works only for VRS streams which show up under the 'Streams' canvas on BNC's main window with 'nmea' stream attribute set to 'yes'. This attribute is either extracted from the Ntrip broadcaster's source-table or introduced by the user through editing the BNC configuration file.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.9 <a name="serfile">File - optional if 'NMEA' is set to 'Auto'</h4></p>
<p>Specify the full path to a file where NMEA messages coming from your serial connected receiver are saved. Default is an empty option field, meaning that no NMEA messages will be saved on disk.
</p>
<p><h4>2.10.10 <a name="serheight">Height - mandatory if 'NMEA' is set to 'Manual'</h4></p>
<p>
Specify an approximate 'Height' above mean sea level in meters for the reference station introduced through 'Mountpoint'. Together with the latitude and longitude from the Ntrip broadcaster source-table the height information is used to build GGA messages to be sent to the Ntrip broadcaster.
</p>
<p>For adjusting latitude and longitude values of a VRS stream given in the 'Streams' canvas you can double click the latitude/longitude data fields, specify appropriate values and then hit Enter.
</p>
<p>This option is only relevant when option 'NMEA' is set to 'Manual GPGGA' or 'Manual GNGGA' respectively.
</p>

<p><h4>2.10.11 <a name="sersampl">Sampling - mandatory if 'NMEA' is set to 'Manual'</h4></p>
<p>
Select a sampling interval in seconds for manual generation and upload of NMEA GGA sentences.
</p>
<p>
A sampling rate of '0' means, that a GGA sentence will be send only once to initialize the requested VRS stream. Note that some VRS systems need GGA sentences at regular intervals.
</p>

<p><h4>2.11 <a name="advnote">Outages</h4></p>
<p>
At any time an incoming stream might become unavailable or corrupted. In such cases, it is important that the BNC operator and/or the stream providers become aware of the situation so that necessary measures can be taken to restore the stream. Furthermore, continuous attempts to decode a corrupted stream can generate unnecessary workload for BNC. Outages and corruptions are handled by BNC as follows:
</p>
<p>
<u>Stream outages:</u> BNC considers a connection to be broken when there are no incoming data detected for more than 20 seconds. When this occurs, BNC will attempt to reconnect at a decreasing rate. It will first try to reconnect with 1 second delay and again in 2 seconds if the previous attempt failed. If the attempt is still unsuccessful, it will try to reconnect within 4 seconds after the previous attempt and so on. The wait time doubles each time with a maximum wait time of 256 seconds.
</p>
<p>
<u>Stream corruption:</u> Not all bits chunk transfers to BNC's internal decoders return valid observations. Sometimes several chunks might be needed before the next observation can be properly decoded. BNC buffers all the outputs (both valid and invalid) from the decoder for a short time span (size derived from the expected 'Observation rate') and then determines whether a stream is valid or corrupted.
</p>
<p>
Outage and corruption events are reported in the 'Log' tab. They can also be passed on as parameters to a shell script or batch file to generate an advisory note to BNC operator or affected stream providers. This functionality lets users utilize BNC as a real-time performance monitor and alarm system for a network of GNSS reference stations.
</p>

<p><h4>2.11.1 <a name="obsrate">Observation Rate - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can collect all returns (success or failure) coming from a decoder within a certain short time span to then decide whether a stream has an outage or its content is corrupted. This procedure needs a rough a priori estimate of the expected observation rate of the incoming streams.</p><p>An empty option field (default) means that you don't want explicit information from BNC about stream outages and incoming streams that cannot be decoded.
</p>

<p><h4>2.11.2 <a name="advfail">Failure Threshold - mandatory if 'Observation rate' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Event 'Begin_Failure' will be reported if no data is received continuously for longer than the 'Failure threshold' time. Similarly, event 'Begin_Corrupted' will be reported when corrupted data is detected by the decoder continuously for longer than this 'Failure threshold' time. The default value is set to 15 minutes and is recommended so not to inundate user with too many event reports.
</p>
<p>
Note that specifying a value of zero '0' for the 'Failure threshold' will force BNC to report any stream failure immediately. Note also that for using this function you need to specify the 'Observation rate'.
</p>

<p><h4>2.11.3 <a name="advreco">Recovery Threshold - mandatory if 'Observation rate' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Once a 'Begin_Failure' or 'Begin_Corrupted' event has been reported, BNC will check for when the stream again becomes available or uncorrupted. Event 'End_Failure' or 'End_Corrupted' will be reported as soon as valid observations are again detected continuously throughout the 'Recovery threshold' time span. The default value is set to 5 minutes and is recommended so not to inundate users with too many event reports.
</p>
<p>
Note that specifying a value of zero '0' for the 'Recovery threshold' will force BNC to report any stream recovery immediately. Note also that for using this function you need to specify the 'Observation rate'.
</p>

<p><h4>2.11.4 <a name="advscript">Script - optional if 'Observation rate' is set</h4></p>
<p>
As mentioned previously, BNC can trigger a shell script or a batch file to be executed when one of the events described are reported. This script can be used to email an advisory note to network operator or stream providers. To enable this feature, specify the full path to the script or batch file in the 'Script' field. The affected stream's mountpoint and type of event reported ('Begin_Outage', 'End_Outage', 'Begin_Corrupted' or 'End_Corrupted') will then be passed on to the script as command line parameters (%1 and %2 on Windows systems or $1 and $2 on Unix/Linux/Mac OS X systems) together with date and time information.
</p>
<p>
Leave the 'Script' field empty if you do not wish to use this option. An invalid path will also disable this option.
</p>
<p>
Examples for command line parameter strings passed on to the advisory 'Script' are:
<pre>
   FFMJ0 Begin_Outage 08-02-21 09:25:59
   FFMJ0 End_Outage 08-02-21 11:36:02 Begin was 08-02-21 09:25:59
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Sample script for Unix/Linux/Mac OS X systems:
</p>
<pre>
   #!/bin/bash
   sleep $((60*RANDOM/32767))
   cat &gt; mail.txt &lt;&lt;EOF
   Advisory Note to BNC User,
   Please note the following advisory received from BNC.
   Stream: $*
   Regards, BNC
   EOF
   mail -s &quot;NABU: $1&quot; email@address &lt; mail.txt
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Note the sleep command in this script which causes the system to wait for a random period of up to 60 seconds before sending the email. This should avoid overloading your mail server in case of a simultaneous failure of many streams.

Specify a mountpoint to apply one or several of the 'Miscellaneous' options to the corresponding stream. Enter 'ALL' if you want to apply these options to all configured streams. An empty option field (default) means that you don't want BNC to apply any of these options.
</p>

<p><h4>2.12.2 <a name="miscperf">Log Latency - optional </h4></p>
<p>
 BNC can average latencies per stream over a certain period of GPS time, the 'Log latency' interval. Mean latencies are calculated from the individual latencies of one (first incoming) observation or Broadcast Correction per second. The mean latencies are then saved in BNC's logfile. Note that computing correct latencies requires the clock of the host computer to be properly synchronized. Note further that visualized latencies from the 'Latency' tab on the bottom of the main window represent individual latencies and not the mean latencies for the logfile.
</p>
<p>
<u>Latency:</u> Latency is defined in BNC by the following equation:
</p>
<pre>
    UTC time provided by BNC's host
  - GPS time of currently processed epoch
  + Leap seconds between UTC and GPS time
  --------------
  = Latency
</pre>
<p>
<u>Statistics:</u> BNC counts the number of GPS seconds covered by at least one observation. It also estimates an observation rate (independent from the a priori specified 'Observation rate') from all observations received throughout the first full 'Log latency' interval. Based on this rate, BNC estimates the number of data gaps when appearing in subsequent intervals.
</p>
<p>
Latencies of observations or corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris and statistical information can be recorded in the 'Log' tab at the end of each 'Log latency' interval. A typical output from a 1 hour 'Log latency' interval would be:
</p>
<pre>
08-03-17 15:59:47 BRUS0: Mean latency 1.47 sec, min 0.66, max 3.02, rms 0.35, 3585 epochs, 15 gaps
</pre>
<p>
Select a 'Log latency' interval to activate this function or select the empty option field if you do not want BNC to log latencies and statistical information.
</p>


<p><h4>2.12.3 <a name="miscscan">Scan RTCM - optional</h4></p>
<p>
When configuring a GNSS receiver for RTCM stream generation, the firmware's setup interface may not provide details about RTCM message types and observation types. As reliable information concerning stream contents should be available i.e. for Ntrip Broadcaster operators to maintain the broadcaster's source-table, BNC allows to scan RTCM streams for incoming message types and printout some of the contained meta-data. Contained observation types are also printed because such information is required a priori for the conversion of RTCM Version 3 MSM streams to RINEX Version 3 files. The idea for this option arose from 'inspectRTCM', a comprehensive stream analyzing tool written by D. St&ouml;cker.
</p>
<p>
Tick 'Scan RTCM' to scan RTCM Version 2 or 3 streams and log all contained
</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers of incoming message types</li>
<li>Antenna Reference Point (ARP) coordinates</li>
<li>Antenna Phase Center (APC) coordinates</li>
<li>Antenna height above marker</li>
<li>Antenna descriptor.</li>
</ul>
In case of RTCM Version 3 streams the output includes
<ul>
<li>RINEX Version 3 Observation Types</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Note that in RTCM Version 2 the message types 18 and 19 carry only the observables of one frequency. Hence it needs two type 18 and 19 messages per epoch to transport the observations from dual frequency receivers.
</p>

<p>
Please note further that RTCM Version 3 message types 1084 for GLONASS don't contain GLONASS channel numbers. Observations from these messages can only be decoded when you include 1020 GLONASS ephemeris messages to your stream which contain the channels. You could also consider adding a second stream carrying 1087 GLONASS observation messages or 1020 GLONASS ephemeris messages as both contain the GLONASS channel numbers.
</p>
<p>

<p>Logged time stamps refer to message reception time and allow understanding repetition rates. Enter 'ALL' if you want to log this information from all configured streams. Beware that the size of the logfile can rapidly increase depending on the number of incoming RTCM streams.
</p>
<p>This option is primarily meant for testing and evaluation. Use it to figure out what exactly is produced by a specific GNSS receiver's configuration. An empty option field (default) means that you don't want BNC to print the message type numbers and antenna information carried in RTCM streams.
</p>


<p><h4>2.12.4 <a name="miscport">Port - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can output streams related to the above specified 'Mountpoint' through a TCP/IP port of your local host. Enter a port number to activate this function. The stream contents remains untouched. BNC does not decode or reformat the data.
</p>
<p>
Be careful when keyword 'ALL' is specified as 'Mountpoint' for involving all incoming streams together because the affiliation of data to certain streams gets lost in the output.
</p>
<p>
 An empty option field (default) means that you don't want BNC to apply the TCP/IP port output option.
</p>


<p><h4>2.13 <a name="pppclient">PPP Client</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can derive coordinates for rover positions following the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) approach. It uses code or code plus phase data from one or more GNSS systems in ionosphere-free linear combinations P3 or L3. Besides pulling streams of observations from dual frequency GNSS receiver, this also
<ul>
<li>Requires pulling in addition a stream carrying satellite orbit and clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris in the form of RTCM Version 3 'State Space Representation' (SSR) messages. Note that for BNC these Broadcast Corrections need to be referred to the satellite's Antenna Phase Center (APC). Streams providing such messages are listed on <u>http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/orbits</u>. Stream 'CLK11' on Ntrip Broadcaster 'products.igs-ip.net:2101' (Caissy et al. 2012) is an example.</li>
<li>May require pulling a stream carrying Broadcast Ephemeris available as RTCM Version 3 message types 1019, 1020, 1043, 1044, 1045, 1046 and 63 (tentative). This becomes a must only when the stream coming from the receiver does not contain Broadcast Ephemeris or provides them only at very low repetition rate. Streams providing such messages are listed on <u>http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/ephemeris</u>. Stream 'RTCM3EPH' on caster 'products.igs-ip.net:2101' is an example.</li>
</ul>
Note that broadcast ephemeris parameters pass through a plausibility check in BNC which allows to ignore incorrect or outdated ephemeris data when necessary, leaving a note 'WRONG EPHEMERIS' or 'OUTDATED EPHEMERIS' in the logfile.
</p>

<p>When using the PPP option, it is important to understand which effects are corrected by BNC.
</p>
<ul>
<li>BNC does correct for Solid Earth Tides and Phase Windup.</li>
<li>Satellite antenna phase center offsets are corrected.</li>
<li>Satellite antenna phase center variations are neglected because this is a small effect usually less than 2 centimeters.</li>
<li>Observations can be corrected for a Receiver Antenna Offset. Depending on whether or not this correction is applied, the estimated position is either that of the receiver's antenna phase center or that of the receiver's Antenna Reference Point.</li>
<li>Receiver antenna phase center variations are not included in the model. The bias caused by this neglect depends on the receiver antenna type. For most antennas it is smaller than a few centimeters.</li>
<li>Ocean and atmospheric loading is neglected. Atmospheric loading is pretty small. Ocean loading is usually also a small effect but may reach up to about 10 centimeters for coastal stations.</li>
<li>Rotational deformation due to polar motion (Polar Tides) is not corrected because this is a small effect usually less than 2 centimeters.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The provider of an orbit/clock corrections stream may switch with his service at any time from a duty to a backup server installation. This shall be noted in the SSR stream through a change of the Issue Of Data (IOD SSR) parameter. The PPP option in BNC will immediately reset all ambiguities in such a situation.
</p>

<p>
PPP options are specified in BNC through the following four panels.
<ul>
<li>PPP (1): Input and output, specifying real-time or post processing mode and associated data sources</li>
<li>PPP (2): Processed stations, specifying sigmas and noise of a priori coordinates and NMEA stream output</li>
<li>PPP (3): Processing options, specifying general PPP processing options</li>
<li>PPP (4): Plots, specifying visualization through time series and track maps</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1 <a name="pppInp">PPP (1): Input and Output</h4></p>
<p>
This panel provides options for specifying the input and output streams and files required by BNC for real-time or post processing PPP.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot03.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 22:</u> Real-time Precise Point Positioning with BNC, PPP Panel 1.</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.1 <a name="pppdatasource">Data Source - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Choose between input from 'Real-time Streams' or 'RINEX Files' for PPP with BNC in real-time or post processing mode.
</p>

<p>
<u>Real-time Streams</u><br>
When choosing 'Real-time Streams' BNC will do PPP solutions in real-time. This requires pulling GNSS observation streams, Broadcast Ephemeris messages and a stream containing corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris. Streams must come in RTCM Version 2 or RTCM Version 3 format.
</p>
<p>
If you don't pull Broadcast Corrections BNC will switch with its solution to 'Single Point Positioning' (SPP) mode.
</p>

<p>
<u>RINEX Files</u><br>
This input mode allows you to specify RINEX Observation, RINEX Navigation and Broadcast Correction files. BNC accepts RINEX Version 2 as well as RINEX Version 3 Observation or Navigation file formats. Files carrying Broadcast Corrections must have the format produced by BNC through the 'Broadcast Corrections' panel. 
</p>
<p>
Specifying only a RINEX Observation and a RINEX Navigation file and no Broadcast Corrections file leads BNC to a 'Single Point Positioning' (SPP) solution.
<p>
<u>Debugging</u><br>
Note that for debugging purposes BNC's real-time PPP functionality can also be used offline. Apply the 'File Mode' 'Command Line' option for that to read a file containing synchronized observations, orbit and clock correctors, and Broadcast Ephemeris. Example:
<pre>
   bnc.exe --conf c:\temp\PPP.bnc --file c:\temp\RAW
</pre>
Such a file (here: 'RAW') must be saved beforehand using BNC's 'Raw output file' option.
</li>
</ul>
</p> 

<p><h4>2.13.1.2 <a name="ppprnxobs">RINEX Observation File - mandatory if 'Data source' is set to 'RINEX Files'</h4></p>
<p>
Specify a RINEX Observation file. The file format can be RINEX Version 2 or RINEX Version 3.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.3 <a name="ppprnxnav">RINEX Navigation File - mandatory if 'Data source' is set to 'RINEX Files'</h4></p>
<p>
Specify a RINEX Navigation file. The file format can be RINEX Version 2 or RINEX Version 3.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.4 <a name="pppcorrstream">Corrections Stream - optional if 'Data source' is set to 'Real-Time Streams'</h4></p>
<p>
Specify a Broadcast 'Corrections stream' from the list of selected 'Streams' you are pulling if you want BNC to correct your satellite ephemeris accordingly. Note that the stream's orbit and clock corrections must refer to the satellite Antenna Phase Center (APC). Streams providing such corrections are made available e.g. through the International GNSS Service (IGS) and listed on <u>http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/orbits</u>. The stream format must be RTCM Version 3 containing so-called SSR messages. Streams 'IGS03' and 'CLK11' supporting GPS plus GLONASS are examples.
</p>
<p>
If you don't specify a 'Corrections stream' BNC will fall back from a PPP solution to a Single Point Positioning (SPP) solution.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.5 <a name="pppcorrfile">Corrections File - optional if 'Data source' is set to 'RINEX Files'</h4></p>
<p>
Specify a Broadcast 'Corrections file' as saved beforehand using BNC. The file contents is basically the ASCII representation of a RTCM Version 3 Broadcast Correction (SSR) stream.
</p>
<p>
If you don't specify a 'Correction file' BNC will fall back from a PPP solution to a Single Point Positioning (SPP) solution.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.6 <a name="pppantexfile">ANTEX File - optional</h4></p>
<p>
IGS provides a file containing absolute phase center corrections for GNSS satellite and receiver antennas in ANTEX format. Entering the full path to such an ANTEX file is required for correcting observations in PPP for antenna phase center offsets and variations. Note that for applying such corrections you need to specify the receiver's antenna name and radome in BNC's 'Coordinates' file.
</p>
<p>
Default value for 'ANTEX file' is an empty option field, meaning that you don't want to correct observations for antenna phase center offsets and variations.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.7 <a name="pppmarkcoor">Coordinates - optional </h4></p>
<p>
Enter the full path to an ASCII file which specifies all streams or files from stationary or mobile receivers you potentially may want to process. Specifying a 'Coordinates' file is optional. If it exists, it should contain one record per stream or file with the following parameters separated by blank characters:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Input data source, to be specified either through
<ul>
<li>the 'Mountpoint' of an RTCM stream (when in real-time PPP mode), or
</li>
<li>the first four characters of the RINEX observations file (when in post processing PPP mode).</li>
</ul>
Having this parameter first in each record is mandatory. BNC can carry out PPP solutions only for streams or files specified here.</li><br>
<li>Only for static observations from a stationary receiver:<br>Approximate a priori XYZ coordinate [m] of the station's marker; specify '0.0 0.0 0.0' if unknown or when observations come from a mobile receiver.</li><br>
<li>Nort, East and Up component [m] of antenna eccentricity which is the difference between Antenna Reference Point (ARP) and a nearby marker position; when specifying the antenna eccentricity BNC will produce coordinates referring to the marker position and not referring to ARP; specify '0.0 0.0 0.0' if eccentricity is unknown or the ARP itself is understood as the marker.</li><br>
<li>Receiver's antenna name as defined in your ANTEX file (see below); Observations will be corrected for the Antenna Phase Center (APC) offsets and variations which may result in a reduction of a few centimeters at max; the specified name must consist of 20 characters; add trailing blanks if the antenna name has less than 20 characters; examples:<br><pre>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'JPSREGANT_SD_E      ' (no radome)
&nbsp; &nbsp;'LEIAT504        NONE' (no radome)
&nbsp; &nbsp;'LEIAR25.R3      LEIT' (radome)</pre>
Leave antenna name blank if you don't want to correct observations for APC offsets and variations or if you don't know the antenna name.</li><br>
<li>
Receiver type following the naming conventions for IGS equipment as defined in <u>https://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/igscb/station/general/rcvr_ant.tab</u>. Specifying the receiver type is only required when saving SINEX Troposphere files. In those files it becomes part of the 'SITE/RECEIVER' specifications, see section 'SNX TRO Directory'.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Records in the 'Coordinates' file with exclamation mark '!' in the first column or blank records will be understood as comment lines and ignored.
</p>
<p>
The following is an example contents for a 'Coordinates' file. Here each record describes the mountpoint of a stream available from the global IGS real-time reference station network. A priori coordinates are followed by North/East/Up eccentricity components of the ARP 
followed by the antenna name and radome in use.

Tick 'Version 3 filenames' to let BNC create so-called extended filenames for PPP logfiles, NMEA files and SINEX Troposphere files to follow the RINEX Version 3 standard, see section 'RINEX Filenames' for details.
</p>
<p>
Default is an empty check box, meaning to create filenames following the RINEX Version 2 standard. The file content is not affected by this option. It only concerns the filename notation.
</p>
<p>
The following are examples for Version 2 filenames:
<p>
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp; CUT018671.nmea</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; NMEA filename, suffix 'nmea'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; CUT018671.ppp</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; PPP logfile name, suffix 'ppp'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; CUT018671J30.tro</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; SINEX Troposphere filename, suffix 'tro'</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
The following are examples for Version 3 filenames:<br>
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp; CUT000AUS_U_20152920000_01D_01S.nmea</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; NMEA filename, suffix 'nmea'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; CUT000AUS_U_20152920000_01D_01S.ppp</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; PPP logfile name, suffix 'ppp'</td></tr>

<p>
Each row reports the PPP result of one epoch. It begins with a UTC time stamp (yy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) which tells us when the result was produced. A second time stamp (yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss) describes the PPP's epoch in 'GPS Time'. It is followed by the derived XYZ position in [m], its North, East and Up displacement compared to an introduced a priori coordinate and the estimated tropospheric delay [m] (model plus correction).
</p>
<p>
If you require more information, you can specify a 'Logfile directory' to save daily logfiles per station (filename suffix 'ppp') with additional processing details on disk.

 Depending on selected processing options you find 'GPS Time' stampes (yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss.sss) followed by
<ul>
<li>RES   : Code and phase residuals for contributing GNSS systems in [m]<br>Given per satellite with cIF/lIF for ionosphere-free linear combination of code/phase observations</li>
<li>CLK   : Receiver clock errors in [m], </li>
<li>AMB   : L3 biases, also known as 'floated ambiguities'<br>Given per satellite with 'nEpo' = number of epochs since last ambiguity reset
<li>OFFGLO: Time offset between GPS time and GLONASS time in [m],
<li>OFFGAL: Time offset between GPS time and Galileo time in [m],
<li>OFFBDS: Time offset between GPS time and BDS time in [m],
<li>TRP   : A priori and correction values of tropospheric zenith delay in [m],
<li>MOUNTPOINT: Here 'CUT07' with X/Y/Z position in [m] and dN/dE/dU in [m] for North, East, and Up displacements compared to a priori marker coordinates.</li>
</ul>
Estimated parameters are presented together with their formal errors as derived from the implemented filter. The PPP algorithm includes outlier and cycle slip detection.
</p>
<p>
Default value for 'Logfile directory' is an empty option field, meaning that you don't want to save daily PPP logfiles on disk. If a specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create PPP logfiles.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.10 <a name="pppnmeafile">NMEA Directory - optional</h4></p>
<p>
You can specify a 'NMEA directory' to save daily NMEA files with Point Positioning results recorded as NMEA sentences. Such sentences are usually generated about once per second with pairs of 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> GPGGA sentences which mainly carry the estimated latitude, longitude, and height values, plus</li>
<li> GPRMC sentences which mainly carry date and time information.</li>

The default value for 'NMEA directory' is an empty option field, meaning that BNC will not save NMEA messages into files. If a specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create NMEA files.
</p>

<p>
Note that Tomoji Takasu has written a program named RTKPLOT for visualizing NMEA sentences from IP ports or files. It is available from http://www.rtklib.com and compatible with the 'NMEA Directory' and port output of BNC's 'PPP' client option.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.11 <a name="pppsnxtrofile">SNX TRO Directory - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC estimates the tropospheric delay according to equation
<pre>
   T(z) = T_apr(z) + dT / cos(z)
</pre>
where T_apr is the a priori tropospheric delay derived from Saastamoinen model. 
</p>

<p>
You can specify a 'SNX TRO Directory' for saving SINEX Troposphere files on disk, see <u>https://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/igscb/data/format/sinex_tropo.txt</u> for a documentation of the file format. Note that receiver type information for these files must be provided through the coordinates file described in section 'Coordinates'. The following is an example for a troposphere file contents:

<p>
The default value for 'SNX TRO Directory' is an empty option field, meaning that BNC will not save SINEX Troposphere files. If a specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create SINEX Troposphere files.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.1.11.1 <a name="pppsnxtrointr">Interval - mandatory if 'SINEX TRO File' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select the length of SINEX Troposphere files.
</p>
<p>
Default 'Interval' for saving SINEX Troposphere files on disk is '1 day'.
</p>


<p><h4>2.13.1.11.2 <a name="pppsnxtrosampl">Sampling - mandatory if 'SINEX TRO File' is set</h4></p>
<p>
Select a 'Sampling' rate in seconds for saving troposphere parameters.
</p>
<p>
Default 'Sampling' rate is '0', meaning that all troposphere estimates will be save on disk.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.2 <a name="pppStation">PPP (2): Processed Stations</h4></p>

<p>
This panel allows to enter parameters specific to each PPP process or thread. Individual sigmas for a priori coordinates and a noise for coordinate variations over time can be introduced. Furthermore, a sigma for model based troposphere estimates and the corresponding noise for troposphere variations can be specified. Finally, local IP server ports can be defined for output of NMEA streams carrying PPP results.
</p>
<p>
BNC offers to create a table with one line per PPP process or thread to specify station-specific parameters. Hit the 'Add Station' button to create a table or add a new line to it. To remove a line from the table, highlight it by clicking it and hit the 'Delete Station' button. You can also remove multiple lines simultaneously by highlighting them using +Shift and +Ctrl.</p>
</p>
<p>
BNC will simultaneously produce PPP solutions for all stations listed in the 'Station' column of this table.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.2.1 <a name="pppsite">Station - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Hit the 'Add Station' button, double click on the 'Station' field, then specify an observation's mountpoint from the 'Streams' section or introduce the 4-character Station ID of your RINEX observation file and hit Enter. BNC will only produce PPP solutions for stations listed in this table.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.2.2 <a name="pppnehsigma">Sigma North/East/Up - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Enter a sigmas in meters for the initial coordinate components. A value of 100.0 (default) may be an appropriate choice. However, this value may be significantly smaller (i.e. 0.01) when starting for example from a station with well-known position - so-called Quick-Start mode.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.2.3 <a name="pppnehnoise">Noise North/East/Up - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Enter a white 'Noise' in meters for estimated coordinate components. A value of 100.0 (default) may be appropriate when considering possible sudden movements of a rover.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.2.4 <a name="ppptropsigma">Tropo Sigma - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Enter a sigma in meters for the a priori model based tropospheric delay estimation. A value of 0.1 (default) may be an appropriate choice.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.2.5 <a name="ppptropnoise">Tropo Noise - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Enter a white 'Noise' in meters per second to describe the expected variation of the tropospheric effect. Supposing 1Hz observation data, a value of 3e-6 (default) would mean that the tropospheric effect may vary for 3600 * 3e-6 = 0.01 meters per hour.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.2.6 <a name="pppnmeaport">NMEA Port - optional</h4></p>
Specify the IP port number of a local port where Point Positioning results become available as NMEA messages. The default value for 'NMEA Port' is an empty option field, meaning that BNC does not provide NMEA messages vi IP port. Note that the NMEA file output and the NMEA IP port output are the same.
</p>
<p>
Note that Tomoji Takasu has written a program named RTKPLOT for visualizing NMEA sentences from IP ports or files. It is available from <u>http://www.rtklib.com</u> and compatible with the NMEA file and port output of BNC's 'PPP' client option.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, NASA's 'World Wind' software (see <u>http://worldwindcentral.com/wiki/NASA_World_Wind_Download</u>) can be used for real-time visualization of positions provided through BNC's NMEA IP output port. You need the 'GPS Tracker' plug-in available from <u>http://worldwindcentral.com/wiki/GPS_Tracker</u> for that. The 'Word Wind' map resolution is not meant for showing centimeter level details.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3 <a name="pppOptions">PPP (3): Processing Options</h4></p>
<p>BNC allows using various Point Positioning processing options depending on the capability of the involved receiver and the application in mind. It also allows introducing specific sigmas for code and phase observations as well as for a priori coordinates and troposphere estimates. You may also like to carry out your PPP solution in Quick-Start mode or enforce BNC to restart a solution if the length of an outage exceeds a certain threshold.
</p>
<p>
The intention of this panel is to specify general processing options to be applied to all PPP threads in one BNC job.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot18.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 24:</u> Precise Point Positioning with BNC, PPP Panel 3.</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3.1 <a name="ppplinecombi">Linear Combinations - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
<p>
Specify on which ionosphere-free Linear Combinations (LCs) of observations you want to base ambiguity resolutions. This implicitly defines the kind of GNSS observations you want to use. The specification is to be done per GNSS system ('GPS LCs', 'GLONASS LCs', 'Galileo LCs', 'BDS LCs').
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting 'P3' means that you request BNC to use code data and the so-called P3 ionosphere-free linear combinations of code observations.</li>
<li>'L3' means that you request BNC to use phase data and the so-called L3 ionosphere-free linear combinations of phase observations.</li>
<li>'P3&L3' means that you request BNC to use both, code and phase data and the so-called P3 and L3 ionosphere-free linear combinations of code and phase observations.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Note that most geodetic GPS receivers support the observation of both, code and phase data. Hence specifying 'P3&L3' would be a good choice for GPS when processing data from such a receiver. If multi-GNSS data processing is your intention, make sure your receiver supports GLONASS and/or Galileo and/or BDS observations besides GPS. Note also that the Broadcast Corrections stream or file which is required for PPP also supports all the systems you have in mind.
</p>
<p>Specifying 'no' means that you don't at all want BNC to use observations from the affected GNSS system.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3.1 <a name="pppcodeobs">Code Observations - mandatory</h4></p>
</p>
Enter a 'Sigma C1' for C1 code observations in meters. The bigger the sigma you enter, the less the contribution of C1 code observations to a PPP solution based on a combination of code and phase data. '2.0' meters is likely to be an appropriate choice.
</p>
<p>
Specify a maximum for residuals 'Max Res C1' for C1 code observations in a PPP solution. '3.0' meters may be an appropriate choice for that. If the maximum is exceeded, contributions from the corresponding observation will be ignored in the PPP solution.
</p>


<p><h4>2.13.3.3 <a name="pppphaseobs">Phase Observations - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Enter a 'Sigma L1' for L1 phase observations in meters. The bigger the sigma you enter, the less the contribution of L1 phase observations to a PPP solutions based on a combination of code and phase data. '0.01' meters is likely to be an appropriate choice.
</p>
<p>
Specify a maximum for residuals 'Max Res L1' for L1 phase observations in a PPP solution. '0.03' meters may be an appropriate choice for that. If the maximum is exceeded, contributions from the corresponding observation will be ignored in the PPP solution.
</p>

<p>
As the convergence characteristic of a PPP solution can be influenced by the ratio of sigmas for code and phase, you may like to introduce sigmas which differ from the default values.
<ul>
<li>Introducing a smaller sigma (higher accuracy) for code observations or a bigger sigma for phase observations leads to better results shortly after program start. However, it may take more time till you finally get the best possible solution.</li>
<li>Introducing a bigger sigma (lower accuracy) for code observations or a smaller sigma for phase observations may lead to less accurate results shortly after program start and thus a prolonged period of convergence but could provide better positions in the long run.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3.4 <a name="pppeleweight">Elevation Dependent Weighting - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
BNC allows elevation dependent weighting when processing GNSS observations. A weight function 
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P = cos&sup2; * z</p>

<p>
with 'z' being the zenith distance to the involved satellite can be applied instead of the simple weight function 'P = 1'.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tick 'Ele Wgt Code' if you want Elevation Dependent Weighting for code observations.</li>
<li>Tick 'Ele Wgt Phase' if you want Elevation Dependent Weighting for phase observations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Default is using the plain weight function 'P = 1' for code and phase observations.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3.5 <a name="pppminobs">Minimum Number of Observations - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Select the minimum number of observations you want to use per epoch. The minimum for parameter 'Min # of Obs' is '4'. This is also the default.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3.6 <a name="pppmineleva">Minimum Elevation - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Select a minimum for satellite elevation angles. Selecting '10 deg' for option 'Min Elevation' may be an appropriate choice.
</p>
<p>
Default is '0 deg' meaning that any observation will be used regardless of the involved satellite elevation angle.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3.7 <a name="pppwaitclockcorr">Wait for Clock Corrections - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Zero value (or 'no') for 'Wait for clock corr.' means that BNC processes each epoch of data immediately after its arrival using satellite clock corrections available at that time. Non-zero value means that epochs of data are buffered and the processing of each epoch is postponed till satellite clock corrections not older than 'Wait for clock corr.' are available. Specifying a value of half the update rate of the clock corrections (i.e. 5 sec) may be appropriate. Note that this causes an additional delay of the PPP solutions in the amount of half of the update rate.
</p>
<p>
Using observations in sync with the corrections can avoid a possible high frequency noise of PPP solutions. Such noise could result from processing observations regardless of how late after a clock correction they were received. Note that applying the 'Wait for clock corr.' option significantly reduces the PPP computation effort for BNC.
</p>
<p>
Default is an empty option field, meaning that you want BNC to process observations immediately after their arrival through applying the latest received clock correction.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.3.8 <a name="pppseeding">Seeding - optional if a priori coordinates specified in 'Coordinates'</h4></p>
<p>
Enter the length of a startup period in seconds for which you want to fix the PPP solution to an known position, see option 'Coordinates'. Constraining a priori coordinates is done in BNC through setting their white 'Noise' temporarily to zero.
</p>
<p>
This so-called Quick-Start option allows the PPP solutions to rapidly converge after startup. It requires that the antenna remains unmoved on the known position throughout the defined period. A value of '60' seconds is likely to be an appropriate choice for 'Seeding'. Default is an empty option field, meaning that you don't want BNC to start in Quick-Start mode.
<p>
You may need to create your own reference coordinate beforehand through running BNC for an hour in normal mode before applying the 'Seeding' option. Don't forget to introduce realistic North/East/Up sigmas under panel 'PPP (2)' according to the coordinate's precision.
</p>

<p>
'Seeding' has also a function for bridging gaps in PPP solutions from failures caused i.e. by longer lasting outages. Should the time span between two consecutive solutions exceed the limit of 60 seconds (maximum solution gap, hard-wired), the algorithm fixes the latest derived coordinate for a period of 'Seeding' seconds. This option avoids time-consuming reconvergences and makes especially sense for stationary operated receivers where convergence can be enforced because a good approximation for the receiver position is known.  
</p>

<p>
The following figure provides the screenshot of an example PPP session with BNC.

<p><h4>2.13.4 <a name="pppPlots">PPP (4): Plots</h4></p>
<p>
This panel presents options for visualizing PPP results as a time series plot or as a track map with PPP tracks on top of OSM or Google maps.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.4.1 <a name="ppptimeseries">PPP Plot - optional</h4></p>
<p>
PPP time series of North (red), East (green) and Up (blue) displacements will be plotted under the 'PPP Plot' tab when this option is ticked. Values will be either referred to an XYZ reference coordinate (if specified, see 'Coordinates') or referred to the first estimated position. The sliding PPP time series window will cover the period of the latest 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Note that a PPP time series makes only sense for a stationary operated receiver.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.4.2 <a name="pppaudioresp">Audio Response - optional</h4></p>
<p>
For natural hazard prediction and monitoring landslides it may be appropriate to generate audio alerts. For that you can specify an 'Audio response' threshold in meters. A beep is produced by BNC whenever a horizontal PPP coordinate component differs by more than the threshold value from the specified marker coordinate.
</p>
<p>
Default is an empty option field, meaning that you don't want BNC to produce acoustic warnings.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.4.3 <a name="ppptrackmap">Track Map - optional</h4></p>
<p>
You may like to track your rover position using Google Maps or OpenStreetMap as a background map. Track maps can be produced with BNC in 'Real-time Streams' mode or in 'RINEX Files' post processing mode with data coming from files.
</p>
<p>
When in 'RINEX Files' post processing mode you should not forget to go online with your host and specify a proxy under the 'Network' panel if that is operated in front of BNC.
</p>
<p>
The 'Open Map' button opens a window showing a map according to the selected 'Google/OSM' option.

<p><h4>2.13.4.4 <a name="pppdotprop">Dot-properties - mandatory before pushing 'Open Map'</h4></p>
<p>
PPP tracks are presented on maps through plotting one colored dot per observation epoch.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.4.4.1 <a name="pppdotsize">Size - mandatory before pushing 'Open Map'</h4></p>
<p>
Specify the size of dots showing the rover position. A dot size of '3' may be appropriate. The maximum possible dot size is '10'. An empty option field or a size of '0' would mean that you don't want BNC to show the rover's track on the map.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.4.4.2 <a name="pppdotcolor">Color - mandatory before pushing 'Open Map'</h4></p>
<p>
Select the color of dots showing the rover track.
</p>

<p><h4>2.13.4.5 <a name="pppspeed">Post Processing Speed - mandatory before pushing 'Open Map'</h4></p>
<p>
With BNC in 'RINEX File' post processing mode for PPP you can specify the speed of computations as appropriate for visualization. Note that you can adjust 'Post-processing speed' on-the-fly while BNC is already processing your observations.
</p>

<p><h4>2.14 <a name="combi">Combine Corrections</h4></p>
<p>
BNC allows processing several orbit and clock correction streams in real-time to produce, encode, upload and save a combination of Broadcast Corrections from various providers. All corrections must refer to satellite Antenna Phase Centers (APC). It is so far only the satellite clock corrections which are combined while orbit corrections in the combination product as well as the product update rates are just taken over from one of the incoming Broadcast Correction streams. Combining only clock corrections using a fixed orbit reference has the possibility to introduce some analysis inconsistencies. We may therefore eventually consider improvements on this approach. The clock combination can be based either on a plain 'Single-Epoch' or on a Kalman 'Filter' approach.
</p>
<p>
In the Kalman Filter approach satellite clocks estimated by individual Analyses Centers (ACs) are used as pseudo observations within the adjustment process. Each observation is modeled as a linear function (actually a simple sum) of three estimated parameters: AC specific offset, satellite specific offset common to all ACs, and the actual satellite clock correction which represents the result of the combination. These three parameter types differ in their statistical properties. The satellite clock offsets are assumed to be static parameters while AC specific and satellite specific offsets are stochastic parameters with appropriate white noise.
 The solution is regularized by a set of minimal constraints. After a change of one of the three values 'SSR Provider ID', 'SSR Solution ID', or 'IOD SSR', the satellite clock offsets belonging to the corresponding analysis center are reset in the adjustment.
</p>
<p>
Removing the AC-dependent biases as well as possible is a major issue with clock combinations. Since they vary in time, it can be tricky to do this. Otherwise, there will be artificial jumps in the combined clock stream if one or more AC contributions drop out for certain epochs. Here the Kalman Filter approach is expected to do better than the Single-Epoch approach.
</p>
<p>
In view of IGS real-time products, the 'Combine Corrections' functionality has been integrated in BNC because
<ul>
<li>The software with its Graphic User Interface and wide range of supported Operating Systems represents a perfect platform to process many Broadcast Correction streams in parallel;</li>
<li>Outages of single AC product streams can be mitigated through merging several incoming streams into a combined product;</li>
<li>Generating a combination product from several AC products allows detecting and rejecting outliers;</li>
<li>A Combination Center (CC) can operate BNC to globally disseminate a combination product via Ntrip broadcast;</li>
<li>An individual AC could prefer to disseminate a stream combined from primary and backup IT resources to reduce outages;</li>
<li>It enables a BNC PPP user to follow his own preference in combining streams from individual ACs for Precise Point Positioning;</li>
<li>It allows an instantaneous quality control of the combination process not only in the time domain but also in the space domain; this can be done through direct application of the combined stream in a PPP solution even without prior upload to an Ntrip Broadcaster;</li>
<li>It provides the means to output SP3 and Clock RINEX files containing precise orbit and clock information for further processing using other tools than BNC.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that the combination process requires real-time access to Broadcast Ephemeris. So, in addition to the orbit and clock correction streams BNC must pull a stream carrying Broadcast Ephemeris in the form of RTCM Version 3 messages. Stream 'RTCM3EPH' on caster <u>products.igs-ip.net</u> is an example for that. Note further that BNC will ignore incorrect or outdated Broadcast Ephemeris data when necessary, leaving a note 'WRONG EPHEMERIS' or 'OUTDATED EPHEMERIS' in the logfile.
</p>

<p>
A combination is carried out following a specified sampling interval. BNC waits for incoming Broadcast Corrections for the period of one such interval. Corrections received later than that will be ignored. If incoming streams have different rates, only epochs that correspond to the sampling interval are used. 
</p>

<p>
With respect to IGS, it is important to understand that a major effect in the combination of GNSS orbit and clock correction streams is the selection of ACs to include. It is likely that a combination product could be improved in accuracy by using only the best two or three ACs. However, with only a few ACs to depend on, the reliability of the combination product could suffer and the risk of total failures increases. So there is an important tradeoff here that must be considered when selecting streams for a combination. The major strength of a combination product is its reliability and stable median performance which can be much better than that of any single AC product.
</p>
<p>
This comment applies in situations where we have a limited number of solutions to combine and their quality varies significantly. The situation may be different when the total number of ACs is larger and the range of AC variation is smaller. In that case, a standard full combination is probably the best.
</p>
<p>
The following recursive algorithm is used to detect orbit outliers in the Kalman Filter combination when Broadcast Corrections are provided by several ACs:
<br>
Step 1: We don't produce a combination for a certain satellite if only one AC provides corrections for it.
<br>
Step 2: A mean satellite position is calculated as the average of positions from all ACs.
<br>
Step 3: For each AC and satellite the 3D distance between individual and mean satellite position is calculated.
<br>
Step 4: We find the greatest difference between AC specific and mean satellite positions.
<br>
Step 5: If that is less than a threshold, the conclusion is that we don't have an outlier and can proceed to the next epoch.
<br>
Step 6: If that is greater than a threshold, then corrections of the affiliated AC are ignored for the affected epoch and the outlier detection restarts with step 1.
</p>
<p>
Note that BNC can produce an internal PPP solution from combined Broadcast Corrections. For that you have to specify the keyword 'INTERNAL' as 'Corrections' mountpoint in the PPP (1) panel.
</p>
<p>
The part of BNC which enables the combination of Broadcast Corrections is not intended for publication under GNU General Public License (GPL). However, pre-compiled BNC binaries which support the 'Combine Corrections' option are made available.
</p>

<p><h4>2.14.1 <a name="combimounttab">Combine Corrections Table - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Hit the 'Add Row' button, double click on the 'Mountpoint' field, enter a Broadcast Corrections mountpoint from the 'Streams' section and hit Enter. Then double click on the 'AC Name' field to enter your choice of an abbreviation for the Analysis Center (AC) providing the Antenna Phase Center (APC) related stream. Finally, double click on the 'Weight' field to enter a weight to be applied to this stream in the combination. 
</p>
<p>
The sequence of entries in the 'Combine Corrections' table is not of importance. Note that the orbit information in the final combination stream is just copied from one of the incoming streams. The stream used for providing the orbits may vary over time: if the orbit providing stream has an outage then BNC switches to the next remaining stream for getting hold of the orbit information.</p>
<p>
It is possible to specify only one Broadcast Ephemeris corrections stream in the 'Combine Corrections' table. Instead of combining corrections from several sources, BNC will then merge the single corrections stream with Broadcast Ephemeris to save results in SP3 and/or Clock RINEX format when specified accordingly under the 'Upload Corrections' panel. Note that in such a BNC application you must not pull more than one Broadcast Ephemeris corrections stream even if a second stream would provide the same corrections from a backup caster.
</p>
<p>
Default is an empty 'Combine Corrections' table meaning that you don't want BNC to combine orbit and clock correction streams.
</p>

<p><h4>2.14.1.1 <a name="combiadd">Add Row, Delete - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Hit 'Add Row' button to add another row to the 'Combine Corrections' table or hit the 'Delete' button to delete the highlighted row(s).
</p>

<p>
The following screenshots describe an example setup of BNC when combining Broadcast Correction streams and uploading them to an Ntrip Broadcaster. Note that this application requires specifying options under panels 'Combine Corrections' and 'Upload Corrections'. The example uses the combination product to simultaneously carry out an 'INTERNAL' PPP solution which allows monitoring the quality of the combination product in the space domain.

Select a clock combination method. Available options are Kalman 'Filter' and 'Single-Epoch. It is suggested to use the Kalman Filter approach in case the combined stream of Broadcast Corrections is intended for Precise Point Positioning.
</p>

<p><h4>2.14.1.3 <a name="combimax">Maximal Residuum - mandatory if 'Combine Corrections' table is populated</h4></p>

<p>BNC combines all incoming clocks according to specified weights. Individual clock estimates that differ by more than 'Maximal Residuum' meters from the average of all clocks will be ignored.<p>
</p>It is suggested to specify a value of about 0.2 m for the Kalman Filter combination approach and a value of about 3.0 meters for the Single-Epoch combination approach.</p>
<p>Default is a 'Maximal Residuum' of 999.0 meters</p>

<p><h4>2.14.1.4 <a name="combismpl">Sampling - mandatory if 'Combine Corrections' table is populated</h4></p>
<p>Specify a combination sampling interval. Orbit and clock corrections will be produced following that interval. A value of 10 sec may be an appropriate choice.</p>

<p><h4>2.14.1.5 <a name="combiGLO">Use GLONASS - optional</h4></p>
<p>
You may tick the 'Use GLONASS' option in case you want to produce a GPS plus GLONASS combination and both systems are supported by the Broadcast Correction streams participating in the combination.
</p>

<p><h4>2.15 <a name="upclk">Upload Corrections</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can upload streams carrying orbit and clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris in radial, along-track and cross-track components if they are<ol type=a>
<li>
either generated by BNC as a combination of several individual Broadcast Correction streams coming from an number of real-time Analysis Centers (ACs), see section 'Combine Corrections',</li>
<li>
or generated by BNC while the program receives an ASCII stream of precise satellite orbits and clocks via IP port from a connected real-time GNSS engine. Such a stream would be expected in a plain ASCII format and the associated 'decoder' string would have to be 'RTNET', see format description below. </li>
</ol>
The procedure taken by BNC to generate the orbit and clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris and upload them to an Ntrip Broadcaster is as follow:
<ul>
<li>Continuously receive up-to-date Broadcast Ephemeris carrying approximate orbits and clocks for all satellites. Read new Broadcast Ephemeris immediately whenever they become available. This information may come via a stream of RTCM messages generated from another BNC instance.</li>
</ul>
Then, epoch by epoch:
<ul>
<li>Continuously receive the best available orbit and clock estimates for all satellites in XYZ Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed IGS08 reference system. Receive them every epoch in plain ASCII format as provided by a real-time GNSS engine such as RTNET or generate them following a combination approach. </li>
<li>Calculate XYZ coordinates from Broadcast Ephemeris orbits. </li>
<li>Calculate differences dX,dY,dZ between Broadcast Ephemeris and IGS08 orbits. </li>
<li>Transform these differences into radial, along-track and cross-track corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris orbits. </li>
<li>Calculate corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris clocks as differences between Broadcast Ephemeris clocks and IGS08 clocks. </li>
<li>Encode Broadcast Ephemeris orbit and clock corrections in RTCM Version 3 format. </li>
<li>Upload Broadcast Corrections stream to Ntrip Broadcaster. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The orbit and clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris are usually referred to the latest set of broadcast messages, which are generally also received in real-time by a GNSS rover. However, the use of the latest broadcast message is delayed for a period of 60 seconds, measured from the time of complete reception of ephemeris and clock parameters, in order to accommodate rover applications to obtain the same set of broadcast orbital and clock parameters. This procedure is recommended in the RTCM SSR standard.
</p>
</p>
Because the stream delivery process may put a significant load on the communication link between BNC and the real-time GNSS engine, it is recommended to run both programs on the same host. However, doing so is not compulsory.
</p>
<p>
The usual handling of BNC when uploading a stream with Broadcast Corrections is that you first specify Broadcast Ephemeris and Broadcast Correction streams. You then specify an Ntrip Broadcaster for stream upload before you start the program.
</p>
<p>
<u>'RTNET' Stream Format</u><br>
When uploading an SSR stream generated according to b. then BNC requires precise GNSS orbits and clocks in the IGS Earth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) reference system and in a specific ASCII format named 'RTNET' because the data may come from a real-time engine such as RTNET. The sampling interval for data transmission should not exceed 15 sec. Note that otherwise tools involved in IP streaming such as Ntrip Broadcasters or Ntrip Clients may respond with a timeout.
</p>
<p>
Below you find an example for the 'RTNET' ASCII format coming from a real-time GNSS engine. Each epoch begins with an asterisk character followed by the time as year, month, day of month, hour, minute and second. Subsequent records can provide 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Satellite specific parameters </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A set of parameters can be defined for each satellite as follows:
<pre>
&lt;SatelliteID&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;numValues&gt; &lt;value1 value2 ...&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;numValues&gt; 
&lt;value1 value2 ...&gt; ...
&nbsp;
</pre>
The following satellite specific keys and values are currently specified in BNC:<br><br>
<table>
<tr><td><i>Key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></td><td><i>Values</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>APC</td><td>Satellite Antenna Phase Center coordinates in meters</td></tr>
<tr><td>Clk</td><td>Satellite clock correction in meters, relativistic correction applied like in broadcast clocks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vel</td><td>Satellite velocity in meters per second</td></tr>
<tr><td>CoM</td><td>Satellite Center of Mass coordinates in meters</td></tr>
<tr><td>CodeBias</td><td>Satellite Code Biases in meters with two characters for frequency and tracking mode per bias as defined in RINEX 3 and preceded by total number of biases</td></tr>
<tr><td>YawAngle</td><td>Satellite Yaw Angle in radian, restricted to be in [0, 2&#960], which shall be used for the computation of phase wind-up correction</td></tr>
<tr><td>YawRate</td><td>Satellite Yaw Rate in radian per second, which is the rate of Yaw Angle</td></tr>
<tr><td>PhaseBias</td><td>Satellite Phase Biases in meters with two characters for frequency and tracking mode per bias as defined in RINEX 3, preceded by total number of biases and followed by Signal Wilde-Lane Integer Indicator as well as Signal Discontinuity Counter</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
<li> Non-satellite specific parameters
</ul>
The following non-satellite specific keys and values are currently specified in BNC:<br><br>
<table>
<tr><td><i>Key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></td><td><i>Values</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>IND</td><td>Stands for phase bias information and is followed by Dispersive Bias Consistency Indicator and MW Consistency Indicator</td></tr>
<tr><td>VTEC</td><td>Stands for Vertical TEC information and is followed by Update Interval and Number of Ionospheric Layers</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
If the key VTEC is specified, a data set for each layer contains within its first line the Layers Number, followed by Maximum Degree, Maximum Order and Layer Height. After that follow Cosine and Sinus Spherical Harmonic Coefficients, one block each.
</p>
<p>
Because each keyword is associated to a certain number of values, an 'old' BNC could be operated with an incoming 'new' RTNET stream containing so far unknown keys - they would just be skipped in BNC.

Note that the end of an epoch in the incoming stream is indicated by an ASCII string 'EOE' (for End Of Epoch).
</p>
<p>
When using clocks from Broadcast Ephemeris (with or without applied corrections) or clocks from SP3 files, it may be important to understand that they are not corrected for the conventional periodic relativistic effect. Chapter 10 of the IERS Conventions 2003 mentions that the conventional periodic relativistic correction to the satellite clock (to be added to the broadcast clock) is computed as dt =  -2 (R * V) / c^2 where R *V is the scalar product of the satellite position and velocity and c is the speed of light. This can also be found in the GPS Interface Specification, IS-GPS-200, Revision D, 7 March 2006.
</p>

<p><h4>2.15.1 <a name="upadd">Add, Delete Row - optional</h4></p>
<p>Hit 'Add Row' button to add a row to the stream 'Upload Table' or hit the 'Delete' button to delete the highlighted row(s).
</p>
<p>
Having an empty 'Upload Table' is default and means that you don't want BNC to upload orbit and clock correction streams to any Ntrip Broadcaster.
</p>

<p><h4>2.14.2 <a name="uphost">Host, Port, Mountpoint, Password - optional</h4></p>

<p>Specify the domain name or IP number of an Ntrip Broadcaster for uploading the stream. Furthermore, specify the caster's listening IP port, an upload mountpoint and an upload password. Note that Ntrip Broadcasters are often configured to provide access through more than one port, usually ports 80 and 2101. If you experience communication problems on port 80, you should try to use the alternative port(s).
</p>
<p>
BNC uploads a stream to the Ntrip Broadcaster by referring to a dedicated mountpoint that has been set by its operator. Specify here the mountpoint based on the details you received for your stream from the operator. It is often a four character ID (capital letters) plus an integer number.</p>
<p>The stream upload may be protected through an upload 'Password'. Enter the password you received from the Ntrip Broadcaster operator along with the mountpoint(s).</p>
<p>
If 'Host', 'Port', 'Mountpoint' and 'Password' are set, the stream will be encoded in RTCM's 'State Space Representation' (SSR) messages and uploaded to the specified broadcaster following the Ntrip Version 1 transport protocol.
</p>

<p><h4>2.15.3 <a name="upsystem">System - mandatory if 'Host' is set</h4></p>
<p>
BNC allows configuring several Broadcast Correction streams for upload so that they refer to different reference systems and different Ntrip Broadcasters. You may use this functionality for parallel support of a backup Ntrip Broadcaster or for simultaneous support of various regional reference systems. Available options for transforming orbit and clock corrections to specific target reference systems are
<p>
<ul>
<li>IGS08 which stands for the GNSS-based IGS realization of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2008 (ITRF2008), and</li>
<li>ETRF2000 which stands for the European Terrestrial Reference Frame 2000 adopted by EUREF, and</li>
<li>NAD83 which stands for the North American Datum 1983 as adopted for the U.S.A., and</li>
<li>GDA94 which stands for the Geodetic Datum Australia 1994 as adopted for Australia, and</li>
<li>SIRGAS2000 which stands for the Geodetic Datum adopted for Brazil, and</li>
<li>SIRGAS95 which stands for the Geodetic Datum adopted i.e. for Venezuela, and</li>
<li>DREF91 which stands for the Geodetic Datum adopted for Germany, and</li>
<li>'Custom' which allows a transformation of Broadcast Corrections from the IGS08 system to any other system through specifying up to 14 Helmert Transformation Parameters.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Because a mathematically strict transformation to a regional reference system is not possible on the BNC server side when a scale factor is involved, the program follows an approximate solution. While <u>orbits</u> are transformed in full accordance with given equations, a transformed <u>clock</u> is derived through applying correction term
</p>
<pre>
   dC = (s - 1) / s * &rho; / c
</pre>
<p>
where s is the transformation scale, c is the speed of light, and &rho; are the topocentric distance between an (approximate) center of the transformation's validity area and the satellite.
</p>
<p>
From a theoretical point of view this kind of approximation leads to inconsistencies between orbits and clocks and is therefore not allowed. However, it has been proved that resulting errors in Precise Point Positioning are on millimeter level for horizontal components and below the one centimeter for height components. The Australian GDA94 transformation with its comparatively large scale parameter is an exception in this as discrepancies may reach up to two centimeters there.
</p>

<p>
<u>IGS08:</u> As the orbits and clocks coming from real-time GNSS engine are expected to be in the IGS08 system, no transformation is carried out if this option is selected.

<p><h4>2.15.4 <a name="upcom">Center of Mass - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC allows to either referring Broadcast Corrections to the satellite's Center of Mass (CoM) or to the satellite's Antenna Phase Center (APC). By default corrections refer to APC. Tick 'Center of Mass' to refer uploaded corrections to CoM.
</p>

<p><h4>2.15.5 <a name="upsp3">SP3 File - optional</h4></p>
<p>Specify a path for saving the generated orbit corrections as SP3 orbit files. If the specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create SP3 orbit files. The following is a path example for a Linux system:

<pre>
   /home/user/BNC${GPSWD}.sp3
</pre>

Note that '${GPSWD}' produces the GPS Week and Day number in the filename.</p>
<p>
Default is an empty option field, meaning that you don't want BNC to save the uploaded stream contents in daily SP3 files.
</p>
<p>
As an SP3 file contents should be referred to the satellites Center of Mass (CoM) while Broadcast Corrections are referred to the satellites APC, an offset has to be applied which is available from an IGS ANTEX file (see option 'ANTEX File' below). Hence you should specify the 'ANTEX File' path there if you want to save the stream contents in SP3 format. If you don't specify an 'ANTEX File' path, the SP3 file contents will be referred to the satellites APCs.
</p>
<p>
The filenames for the daily SP3 files follow the convention for SP3 filenames. The first three characters of each filename are set to 'BNC'. Note that clocks in the SP3 orbit files are not corrected for the conventional periodic relativistic effect.
</p>
<p>
In case the 'Combine Corrections' table contains only one Broadcast Corrections stream, BNC will merge that stream with Broadcast Ephemeris to save results in files specified here through SP3 and/or Clock RINEX file path. In such a case you have to define only the SP3 and Clock RINEX file path and no further option in the 'Upload Corrections' table.
</p>

<p>
Note that BNC outputs a complete list of SP3 'Epoch Header Records' even if no 'Position and Clock Records' are available for certain epochs because of stream outages. Note further that the 'Number of Epochs' in the first SP3 header record may not be correct because that number is not available when the file is created. Depending on your processing software (e.g. Bernese GNSS Software, BSW) it could therefore be necessary to correct an incorrect 'Number of Epochs' in the file before you use in Post Processing.
</p>

<p><h4>2.15.6 <a name="uprinex">RNX File - optional</h4></p>
<p>
The clock corrections generated by BNC for upload can be logged in Clock RINEX format. The file naming follows the RINEX convention.
</p>
<p>
Specify a path for saving the generated clock corrections as Clock RINEX files. If the specified directory does not exist, BNC will not create Clock RINEX files. The following is a path example for a Linux system:
<pre>
   /home/user/BNC${GPSWD}.clk
</pre>
Note that '${GPSWD}' produces the GPS Week and Day number in the filename.
</p>
<p>
Note further that clocks in the Clock RINEX files are not corrected for the conventional periodic relativistic effect.
</p>

<p><h4>2.15.7 <a name="upinter">Interval - mandatory if 'Upload Table' entries specified</h4></p>
<p>
Select the length of Clock RINEX files and SP3 Orbit files. The default value is 1 day.
</p>

<p><h4>2.15.8 <a name="upclksmpl">Sampling</h4></p>
<p>BNC requires an orbit corrections sampling interval for the stream to be uploaded and sampling intervals for SP3 and Clock RINEX files. The outgoing stream's clock correction sampling interval follows that of incoming corrections and is therefore nothing to be specified here.</p>

<p><h4>2.15.8.1 <a name="upclkorb">Orbits (Orb) - mandatory if 'Upload Table' entries specified</h4></p>
<p>Select the stream's orbit correction sampling interval in seconds. A value of 60 sec may be appropriate.</p>
<p> A value of zero '0' tells BNC to upload all orbit correction samples coming in from the real-time GNSS engine along with the clock correction samples to produce combined orbit and clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris (1060 for GPS, 1066 for GLONASS).
</p>
<p>
Configuration examples:
</p>
Let us suppose a real-time network engine supporting BNC every <u>5 sec</u> with GPS Broadcast Corrections for orbits, clocks and code biases in 'RTNET' stream format.
<ul>
<li>With 'Sampling Orb' set to '0'  BNC will produce</li>
<ul>
<li>Every 5 sec a 1059 message for GPS code biases,</li>
<li>Every 5 sec a 1060 message for combined orbit and clock corrections to GPS Broadcast Ephemeris.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>With 'Sampling Orb' set to '5' BNC will produce</li>
<ul> 
<li>Every 5 sec a 1057 message for GPS orbit corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris,</li>
<li>Every 5 sec a 1058 message for GPS clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris,</li>
<li>Every 5 sec a 1059 message for GPS code biases.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>With 'Sampling Orb' set to '10' BNC will produce</li>
<ul> 
<li>Every 10 sec a 1057 message for GPS orbit corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris,</li>
<li>Every 5 sec a 1058 message for GPS clock corrections to Broadcast Ephemeris,</li>
<li>Every 5 sec a 1059 message for GPS code biases.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
Note that only when specifying a value of zero '0' (default) for 'Sampling Orb', BNC produces <u>combined</u> orbit and clock correction messages.
<p><h4>2.15.8.2 <a name="upclksp3">SP3 - mandatory if 'SP3 File' is specified</h4></p>
<p>Select the SP3 orbit file sampling interval in minutes. A value of 15 min may be appropriate. A value of zero '0' tells BNC to store all available samples into SP3 orbit files.</p>

<p><h4>2.15.8.3 <a name="upclkrnx">RINEX (RNX) - mandatory if 'RNX File' is specified</h4></p>
<p>Select the Clock RINEX file sampling interval in seconds. A value of 10 sec may be appropriate. A value of zero '0' tells BNC to store all available samples into Clock RINEX files.</p>

<p><h4>2.15.9 <a name="upcustom">Custom Trafo - optional if 'Upload Table' entries specified</h4></p>
<p>Hit 'Custom Trafo' to specify your own 14 parameter Helmert Transformation instead of selecting a predefined transformation through 'System' button.</p>

<p>
The following screenshot shows the encoding and uploading of a stream of precise orbits and clocks coming from a real-time engine in 'RTNET' ASCII format. The stream is uploaded to Ntrip Broadcaster 'products.igs-ip.net'. It is referred to APC and IGS08. Uploaded data are locally saved in SP3 and Clock RINEX format. The SSR Provider ID is set to 3. The SSR Solution ID is and the Issue of Data SSR are set to 1. Required Broadcast Ephemeris are received via stream 'RTCM3EPH'.
</p>
<p><img src="IMG/screenshot26.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 32:</u> Producing Broadcast Corrections from incoming precise orbits and clocks and uploading them to an Ntrip Broadcaster.</p>

<p><h4>2.15.10 <a name="upantex">ANTEX File - mandatory if 'SP3 File' is specified</h4></p>
<p>
IGS provides a file containing absolute phase center variations for GNSS satellite and receiver antennas in ANTEX format. Entering the full path to such an ANTEX file is required here for referring the SP3 file contents to the satellite's Center of Mass (CoM). If you don't specify a ANTEX file, the SP3 file will contain orbit information which is referred to Antenna Phase Center (APC) instead of CoM.
</p>

<p><h4>2.16 <a name="upeph">Upload Ephemeris</h4></p>
<p>
BNC can generate a stream carrying only Broadcast Ephemeris in RTCM Version 3 format and upload it to an Ntrip Broadcaster.
</p>

<p>
Note that broadcast ephemeris received in real-time have a system specific period of validity in BNC which is defined in accordance with the update rates of the navigation messages.
<ul>
<li>GPS ephemeris will be interpreted as outdated and ignored when older than 4 hours.</li>
<li>GLONASS ephemeris will be interpreted as outdated and ignored when older than 1 hour.</li>
<li>Galileo ephemeris will be interpreted as outdated and ignored when older than 4 hours.</li>
<li>BDS ephemeris will be interpreted as outdated and ignored when older than 6 hours.</li>
<li>SBAS ephemeris will be interpreted as outdated and ignored when older than 10 minutes.</li>
<li>QZSS ephemeris will be interpreted as outdated and ignored when older than 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
A note 'OUTDATED EPHEMERIS' will be given in the logfile and the data will be disregarded when necessary. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, received broadcast ephemeris parameters pass through a plausibility check in BNC which allows to ignore incorrect ephemeris data when necessary, leaving a note 'WRONG EPHEMERIS' in the logfile.
</p>

<p><h4>2.16.1 <a name="brdcserver">Host &amp; Port - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Specify the 'Host' IP number or URL of an Ntrip Broadcaster to upload the stream. An empty option field means that you don't want to upload Broadcast Ephemeris.
</p>
<p>
Enter the Ntrip Broadcaster's IP 'Port' number for stream upload. Note that Ntrip Broadcasters are often configured to provide access through more than one port, usually ports 80 and 2101. If you experience communication problems on port 80, you should try to use the alternative port(s).
</p>

<p><h4>2.16.2 <a name="brdcmount">Mountpoint &amp; Password - mandatory if 'Host' is set</h4></p>
<p>
BNC uploads a stream to the Ntrip Broadcaster by referring to a dedicated mountpoint that has been set by its operator. Specify the mountpoint based on the details you received for your stream from the operator. It is often a four character ID (capital letters) plus an integer number.</p>
<p>The stream upload follows Ntrip Version 1 and may be protected through an upload 'Password'. Enter the password you received from the Ntrip Broadcaster operator along with the mountpoint.</p>
</p>

<p><h4>2.16.3 <a name="brdcsmpl">Sampling - mandatory if 'Host' is set</h4></p>
Select the Broadcast Ephemeris repetition interval in seconds. Default is '5' meaning that a complete set of Broadcast Ephemeris is uploaded every 5 seconds.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot28.png"/></p>

<p><h4>2.17 <a name="streams">Streams Canvas</h4></p>
<p>
Each stream on an Ntrip Broadcaster (and consequently on BNC) is defined using a unique source ID called mountpoint. An Ntrip Client like BNC accesses the desired stream by referring to its mountpoint. Information about streams and their mountpoints is available through the source-table maintained by the Ntrip Broadcaster.
</p>

<p>
Streams selected for retrieval are listed under the 'Streams' canvas on BNC's main window. The list provides the following information either extracted from source-table(s) produced by the Ntrip Broadcasters or introduced by BNC's user:
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr><td>'resource loader'&nbsp; </td><td>Ntrip Broadcaster URL and port, or<br>TCP/IP host and port, or<br>UDP port, or<br>Serial input port specification.</td></tr>
<tr><td>'mountpoint' &nbsp;</td><td>Mountpoint introduced by Ntrip Broadcaster, or<br>Mountpoint introduced by BNC's user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>'decoder' &nbsp;</td><td>Name of decoder used to handle the incoming stream content according to its format; editable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>'lat' &nbsp;</td><td>Approximate latitude of reference station, in degrees, north; editable if 'nmea' = 'yes'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>'long' &nbsp;</td><td>Approximate longitude of reference station, in degrees, east; editable if 'nmea' = 'yes'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>'nmea' &nbsp;</td><td>Indicates whether or not streaming needs to be initiated by BNC through sending NMEA-GGA message carrying position coordinates in 'lat' and 'long'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>'ntrip' &nbsp;</td><td>Selected Ntrip transport protocol version (1, 2, 2s, R, or U), or<br>'N' for TCP/IP streams without Ntrip, or<br>'UN' for UDP streams without Ntrip, or<br>'S' for serial input streams without Ntrip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>'bytes' &nbsp;</td><td>Number of bytes received.
</table>
</p>

<p><h4>2.17.1 <a name="streamedit">Edit Streams</h4></p>
<ul>
<li>
BNC automatically allocates one of its internal decoders to a stream based on the stream's 'format' and 'format-details' as given in the source-table. However, there might be cases where you need to override the automatic selection due to incorrect source-table for example. BNC allows users to manually select the required decoder by editing the decoder string. Double click on the 'decoder' field, enter your preferred decoder and then hit Enter. The accepted decoder strings are 'RTCM_2.x', 'RTCM_3.x' and 'RTNET'.
</li>
<li>
In case you need to log the raw data as is, BNC allows users to by-pass its decoders and directly save the input in daily logfiles. To do this, specify the decoder string as 'ZERO'. The generated filenames are created from the characters of the streams mountpoints plus two-digit numbers each for year, month, and day. Example: Setting the 'decoder' string for mountpoint WTZZ0 to 'ZERO' and running BNC on March 29, 2007 would save the raw data in a file named WTZZ0_070329.
</li>
<li>
BNC can also retrieve streams from virtual reference stations (VRS). To initiate these streams, an approximate rover position needs to be sent in NMEA format to the Ntrip Broadcaster. In return, a user-specific data stream is generated, typically by Network-RTK software. VRS streams are indicated by a 'yes' in the source-table as well as in the 'nmea' column on the 'Streams' canvas in BNC's main window. They are customized exactly to the latitude and longitude transmitted to the Ntrip Broadcaster via NMEA-GGA messages.
<br>If NMEA-GGA messages are not coming from a serial connected GNSS rover, BNC simulates them from the default latitude and longitude of the source-table as shown in the 'lat' and 'long' columns on the 'Streams' canvas. However, in most cases you would probably want to change these defaults according to your requirement. Double-click on 'lat' and 'long' fields, enter the values you wish to send and then hit Enter. The format is in positive north latitude degrees (e.g. for northern hemisphere: 52.436, for southern hemisphere: -24.567) and eastern longitude degrees (example: 358.872 or -1.128). Only streams with a 'yes' in their 'nmea' column can be edited. The position must preferably be a point within the VRS service area of the network. RINEX files generated from these streams will contain an additional COMMENT line in the header beginning with 'NMEA' showing the 'lat' and 'long' used.
<br>Note that when running BNC in a Local Area Network (LAN), NMEA strings may be blocked by a proxy server, firewall or virus scanner when not using the Ntrip Version 2 transport protocol.
</li>
</ul>

<p><h4>2.17.2 <a name="streamdelete">Delete Stream</h4></p>
<p>
To remove a stream from the 'Streams' canvas in the main window, highlight it by clicking on it and hit the 'Delete Stream' button. You can also remove multiple streams simultaneously by highlighting them using +Shift and +Ctrl.</p>

<p><h4>2.17.3 <a name="streamconf">Reconfigure Stream Selection On-the-fly</h4></p>
<p>
The streams selection can be changed on-the-fly without interrupting uninvolved threads in the running BNC process.
</p>
<p>
<u>Window mode:</u> Hit 'Reread &amp; Save Configuration' while BNC is in window mode and already processing data to let changes of your streams selection immediately become effective.
<p>
<u>No window mode:</u> When operating BNC online in 'no window' mode (command line option -nw), you force BNC to reread its 'mountPoints' configuration option from disk at pre-defined intervals. Select '1 min', '1 hour', or '1 day' as 'Reread configuration' option to reread the 'mountPoints' option every full minute, hour, or day. This lets a 'mountPoints' option edited in between in the configuration file become effective without terminating uninvolved threads. See section 'Configuration Examples' for a configuration file example and section 'Reread Configuration' for a list of other on-the-fly changeable options.
</p>

<p><h4>2.18 <a name="logs">Logging Canvas</h4></p>
<p>
The 'Logging Canvas' above the bottom menu bar on the main window labeled 'Log', 'Throughput', 'Lacenty', and 'PPP Plot' provides control of BNC's activities. Tabs are available for continuously showing logfile contents, for a plot controlling the bandwidth consumption, for a plot showing stream latencies, and for time series plots of PPP results.
</p>
<p><h4>2.18.1 <a name="logfile">Log</h4></p>
<p>
Records of BNC's activities are shown in the 'Log' tab. They can be saved into a file when a valid path is specified in the 'Logfile (full path)' field.
</p>

<p><h4>2.18.2 <a name="throughput">Throughput</h4></p>
<p>
The bandwidth consumption per stream is shown in the 'Throughput' tab in bits per second (bps) or kilobits per second (kbps). The following figure shows an example for the bandwidth consumption of incoming streams.
</p>

<p><img src="IMG/screenshot08.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 34:</u> Bandwidth consumption of incoming streams.</p>

<p><h4>2.18.3 <a name="latency">Latency</h4></p>
<p>
The latency of observations in each incoming stream is shown in the 'Latency' tab in milliseconds or seconds. Streams not carrying observations (i.e. those providing only Broadcast Ephemeris messages) or having an outage are not considered here and shown in red color. Note that the calculation of correct latencies requires the clock of the host computer to be properly synchronized. The next figure shows an example for the latency of incoming streams.
</p>

<p><u>Figure 35:</u> Latency of incoming streams.</p>

<p><h4>2.18.4 <a name="ppptab">PPP Plot</h4></p>
<p>
Precise Point Positioning time series of North (red), East (green) and Up (blue) coordinate components are shown in the 'PPP Plot' tab when a 'Origin' option is defined. Values are either referred to reference coordinates (if specified) or referred to the first estimated set of coordinate components. The time as given in format [hh:mm] refers to GPS Time. The sliding PPP time series window covers a period of 5 minutes. Note that it may take up to 30 seconds or more till the first PPP solutions becomes available. The following figure shows the screenshot of a PPP time series plot of North, East and Up coordinate components.

<p><h4>2.19.1 <a name="streamadd">Add Stream</h4></p>
<p>
Button 'Add Stream' allows you to pull streams either from a Ntrip Broadcaster or from a TCP/IP port, UPD port, or serial port.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.1 <a name="streamcaster">Add Stream - Coming from Caster</h4></p>

<p>
Button 'Add Stream' &gt; 'Coming from Caster' then opens a window that allows user to select data streams from an Ntrip Broadcaster according to their mountpoints and show a distribution map of offered streams.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.1.1 <a name="streamhost">Caster Host and Port - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Enter the Ntrip Broadcaster host IP and port number. Note that EUREF and IGS operate Ntrip Broadcasters at <u>http://www.euref-ip.net/home</u>, <u>http://www.igs-ip.net/home</u>, <u>http://www.products.igs-ip.net/home</u> and <u>http://mgex.igs-ip.net/home</u>.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.1.2 <a name="streamtable">Casters Table - optional</h4></p>
<p>
It may be that you are not sure about your Ntrip Broadcasters host and port number or you are interested in other broadcaster installations operated elsewhere. Hit 'Show' for a table of known broadcasters maintained at <u>www.rtcm-ntrip.org/home</u>. A window opens which allows selecting a broadcaster for stream retrieval, see figure below.

<p><u>Figure 38:</u> Casters table.</p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.1.3 <a name="streamuser">User and Password - mandatory for protected streams</h4></p>
<p>
Streams on Ntrip Broadcasters may be protected. Enter a valid 'User' ID and 'Password' for access to protected streams. Accounts are usually provided per Ntrip Broadcaster through a registration procedure. Register through <u>http://register.rtcm-ntrip.org</u> for access to protected streams from EUREF and IGS.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.1.4 <a name="gettable">Get Table</h4></p>
<p>
Use the 'Get Table' button to download the source-table from the Ntrip Broadcaster. Pay attention to data fields 'format' and 'format-details'. Keep in mind that BNC can only decode and convert streams that come in RTCM Version 2, RTCM Version 3, or RTNET format. For access to observations, Broadcast Ephemeris and Broadcast Corrections in RTCM format streams must contain a selection of appropriate message types as listed in the Annex, cf. data field 'format-details' for available message types and their repetition rates in brackets. Note that in order to produce RINEX Navigation files RTCM Version 3 streams containing message types 1019 (GPS) and 1020 (GLONASS) and 1043 (SBAS) and 1044 (QZSS) and 1045, 1046 (Galileo) and 63 (tentative, BDS/BeiDou) are required. Select your streams line by line, use +Shift and +Ctrl when necessary. The figure below provides an example source-table.
</p>
<p>
The contents of data field 'nmea' tells you whether a stream retrieval needs to be initiated by BNC through sending an NMEA-GGA message carrying approximate position coordinates (virtual reference station).
</p>
<p>
Hit 'OK' to return to the main window. If you wish you can click on 'Add Stream' and repeat the process again to retrieve streams from different casters.

<p><h4>2.19.1.1.5 <a name="ntripv">Ntrip Version - mandatory</h4></p>
<p>
Some limitations and deficiencies of the Ntrip Version 1 stream transport protocol are solved in Ntrip Version 2. Improvements mainly concern a full HTTP compatibility in view of requirements coming from proxy servers. Version 2 is backwards compatible to Version 1. Options implemented in BNC are:
</p>

<p>
<table>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td><b>Option &nbsp;  &nbsp; </b></td><td><b>Meaning</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1</td><td>Ntrip Version 1, TCP/IP</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2</td><td>Ntrip Version 2 in TCP/IP mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2s</td><td>Ntrip Version 2 in TCP/IP mode via SSL</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; R</td><td>Ntrip Version 2 in RTSP/RTP mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; U</td><td>Ntrip Version 2 in UDP mode</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
If Ntrip Version 2 is supported by the broadcaster:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Try using option '2' if your streams are otherwise blocked by a proxy server operated in front of BNC.</li>
<li>When using Ntrip Version 2 via SSL (option '2s') you need to specify the appropriate 'Caster port' for that. It's usually port number 443. Clarify 'SSL' options offered in panel 'Network'.</li>
<li>Option 'R' or 'U' may be selected if latency is more important than completeness for your application. Note that the latency reduction is likely to be in the order of 0.5 sec or less. Note further that options 'R' (RTSP/RTP mode) and 'U' (UDP mode) are not accepted by proxy servers and a mobile Internet Service Provider may not support it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Select option '1' if you are not sure whether the broadcaster supports Ntrip Version 2.</li>
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.1.6 <a name="castermap">Map - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Button 'Map' opens a window to show a distribution map of the caster's streams. You may like to zoom in or out using the mouse. Left button: draw a rectangle to zoom, right button: zoom out, middle button: zoom back.

<p><h4>2.19.1.2 <a name="streamip">Add Stream - Coming from TCP/IP Port</h4></p>
<p>
Button 'Add Stream' &gt; 'Coming from TCP/IP Port' allows to retrieve streams via TCP directly from an IP address without using the Ntrip transport protocol. For that you:
<ul>
<li>Enter the IP address of the stream providing host.</li>
<li>Enter the IP port number of the stream providing host.</li>
<li>Specify a mountpoint. Recommended is a 4-character station ID. Example: FFMJ</li>
<li>Specify the stream format. Available options are 'RTCM_2', 'RTCM_3', 'RTNET', and 'ZERO'.</li>
<li>Enter the approximate latitude of the stream providing rover in degrees. Example: 45.32.</li>
<li>Enter the approximate longitude of the stream providing rover in degrees. Example: -15.20.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Streams directly received from a TCP/IP port show up with an 'N' for 'No Ntrip' in the 'Streams' canvas on BNC's main window. Latitude and longitude are to be entered just for informal reasons.
<p>
</p>
Note that this option works only if no proxy server is involved in the communication link.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.3 <a name="streamudp">Add Stream - Coming from UDP Port</h4></p>
<p>
Button 'Add Stream' &gt; 'Coming from UDP Port' allows to pick up streams arriving directly at one of the local host's UDP ports without using the Ntrip transport protocol. For that you:
<ul>
<li>Enter the local port number where the UDP stream arrives.</li>
<li>Specify a mountpoint. Recommended is a 4-character station ID. Example: FFMJ</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
Streams directly received at a UDP port show up with a 'UN' for 'UDP, No Ntrip' in the 'Streams' canvas section on BNC's main window. Latitude and longitude are to be entered just for informal reasons.
<p>

<p><h4>2.19.1.4 <a name="streamser">Add Stream - Coming from Serial Port</h4></p>
<p>
Button 'Add Stream' &gt; 'Coming from Serial Port' allows to retrieve streams from a GNSS receiver via serial port without using the Ntrip transport protocol. For that you:
<ul>
<li>Specify a mountpoint. Recommended is a 4-character station ID. Example: FFMJ</li>
<li>Specify the stream format. Available options are 'RTCM_2', 'RTCM_3', 'RTNET', and 'ZERO'.</li>
<li>Enter the approximate latitude of the stream providing receiver in degrees. Example: 45.32.</li>
<li>Enter the approximate longitude of the stream providing receiver in degrees. Example: -15.20.</li>
<li>Enter the serial 'Port name' selected on your host for communication with the receiver. Valid port names are
<pre>
Windows:       COM1, COM2
Linux:         /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1
FreeBSD:       /dev/ttyd0, /dev/ttyd1
Digital Unix:  /dev/tty01, /dev/tty02
HP-UX:         /dev/tty1p0, /dev/tty2p0
SGI/IRIX:      /dev/ttyf1, /dev/ttyf2
SunOS/Solaris: /dev/ttya, /dev/ttyb
</pre>
</li>
<li>Select a 'Baud rate' for the serial input. Note that using a high baud rate is recommended.</li>
<li>Select the number of 'Data bits' for the serial input. Note that often '8' data bits are used.</li>
<li>Select the 'Parity' for the serial input. Note that parity is often set to 'NONE'.</li>
<li>Select the number of 'Stop bits' for the serial input. Note that often '1' stop bit is used.</li>
<li>Select a 'Flow control' for the serial link. Select 'OFF' if you don't know better.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When selecting one of the serial communication options listed above, make sure that you pick those configured to the serial connected GNSS receiver.
</p>

<p>
Streams received from a serial connected GNSS receiver show up with an 'S' (for <u>S</u>erial Port, no Ntrip) in the 'Streams' canvas section on BNC's main window. Latitude and longitude are to be entered just for informal reasons.
<p>

<p>
The following figure shows a BNC example setup for pulling a stream via serial port on a Linux operating system.
</p>
<p><img src="IMG/screenshot15.png"/></p>
<p><u>Figure 41:</u> BNC setup for pulling a stream via serial port.</p>

<p><h4>2.19.2 <a name="streamsdelete">Delete Stream</h4></p>
<p>
Button 'Delete Stream' allows you to delete streams previously selected for retrieval as listed under the 'Streams' canvas on BNC's main window.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.3 <a name="streamsmap">Map</h4></p>
<p>
Button 'Map' opens a window to show a distribution map of the streams selected for retrieval as listed under the 'Streams' canvas. You may like to zoom in or out using the mouse. Left button: draw a rectangle to zoom, right button: zoom out, middle button: zoom back.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.4 <a name="start">Start</h4></p>
<p>
Hit 'Start' to start retrieving, decoding or converting GNSS data streams in real-time. Note that 'Start' generally forces BNC to begin with fresh RINEX which might overwrite existing files when necessary unless the option 'Append files' is ticked.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.5 <a name="stop">Stop</h4></p>
<p>
Hit the 'Stop' button in order to stop BNC.
</p>

<p><h4>2.19.6 <a name="contexthelp">Help? = Shift+F1</h4></p>
<p>
BNC comes with a <i>What's This</i> help system providing online information about its functionality and usage. Short descriptions are available for any widget and program option. Focus to the relevant object and press Shift+F1 to request help information. A help text appears immediately; it disappears as soon as the user does something else. The dialogs on some operating systems may provide a '?' button that users can click; click the relevant widget to pop up the help text.
</p>

<p><h4>2.20 <a name="cmd">Command Line Options</h4></p>
<p>
Command line options are available to run BNC in 'no window' mode or let it read previously recorded input offline from one or several files for debugging purposes. It is also possible to introduce a specific configuration filename instead of using the default filename 'BNC.bnc'. The self-explaining contents of the configuration file can easily be edited. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to reading processing options from the involved configuration file, BNC can optionally read any configuration option from command line. Running BNC with command line option 'help'
</p>
<p>
Example:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bnc.exe --help
</p>
<p>
provides a list of all available command line options.
</p>

<p><h4>2.20.1 <a name="cmdVersion">Version - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Command line option '--version' lets BNC print its version number.
</p>
<p>
Example:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bnc.exe --version
</p>

<p><h4>2.20.2 <a name="cmdDisplay">Display - optional</h4></p>
<p>
On systems which support graphics command line option '--display' forces BNC to present the BNC window on the specified display.
</p>
<p>
Example:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bnc.exe --display localhost:10.0
</p>

<p><h4>2.20.3 <a name="nw">No Window Mode - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Apart from its regular windows mode, BNC can be started on all systems as a batch job with command line option '-nw'. BNC will then run in 'no window' mode, using processing options from its configuration file on disk. Terminate BNC using Windows Task Manager when running it in 'no window' mode on Windows systems.
</p>
<p>
Example:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bnc.exe --nw
</p>
<p>
It is obvious that BNC requires graphics support when started in interactive
mode. But, note that it also requires graphics support when producing plots in
batch mode (option -nw). Windows and Mac OS X systems always support graphics. For
producing plots in batch mode on Linux systems you must make sure that at
least a virtual X-Server such as 'Xvfb' is installed and the '-display' option
is used. The following is an example shell script to execute BNC in batch mode
for producing QC plots from RINEX files. It could be used via 'crontab':
</p>
<pre>
   #!/bin/bash

   # Save string localhost
   echo "localhost" > /home/user/hosts

   # Start virtual X-Server, save process ID
   /usr/bin/Xvfb :29 -auth /home/user/hosts -screen 0 1280x1024x8 &
   psID=`echo $!`

   # Run BNC application with defined display variable
   /home/user/BNC/bnc --conf /dev/null --key reqcAction Analyze --key reqcObsFile ons12090.12o --key reqcNavFile brdc2090.12p --key reqcOutLogFile multi.txt --key reqcPlotDir /home/user --display localhost:29 --nw

   # BNC done, kill X-server process
   kill $psID
</pre>

<p><h4>2.20.4 <a name="post">File Mode - optional</h4></p>
<p>
Although BNC is primarily a real-time online tool, for debugging purposes it can be run offline to read data from a file previously saved through option 'Raw output file'. Enter the following command line option for that
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --file &lt;<u>inputFileName</u>&gt;
</p>

and specify the full path to an input file containing previously saved data. Example:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ./bnc --file /home/user/raw.output_110301
</p>
<p>
Note that when running BNC offline, it will use options for file saving, interval, sampling, PPP etc. from its configuration file.
</p>
<p>Note further that option '--file' forces BNC to apply the '-nw' option for running in 'no window' mode.
</p>

<p><h4>2.20.5 <a name="conffile">Configuration File - optional</h4></p>
The default configuration filename is 'BNC.bnc'. You may change this name at startup time using the command line option '--conf &lt;<u>confFileName</u>&gt;'. This allows running several BNC jobs in parallel on the same host using different sets of configuration options. <u>confFileName</u> stands either for the full path to a configuration file or just for a filename. If you introduce only a filename, the corresponding file will be saved in the current working directory from where BNC is started.
</p>
<p>
Example:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ./bnc --conf MyConfig.bnc
</p>
<p>
This leads to a BNC job using configuration file 'MyConfig.bnc'. The configuration file will be saved in the current working directory.
</p>

<p><h4>2.20.6 <a name="confopt">Configuration Options - optional</h4></p>
<p>
BNC applies options from the configuration file but allows updating every one of them on the command line while the contents of the configuration file remains unchanged. Note the following syntax for Command Line Interface (CLI) options:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --key &lt;keyName&gt; &lt;keyValue&gt;
</p>
<p>
Parameter &lt;keyName&gt; stands for the name of an option contained in the configuration file and &lt;keyValue&gt; stands for the value you want to assign to it. The following is a syntax example for a complete command line:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bnc --nw --conf &lt;confFileName&gt --key &lt;keyName1&gt; &lt;keyValue1&gt; --key &lt;keyName2&gt; &lt;keyValue2&gt; ...
</p>
<p>
Configuration options which are part of the configuration files PPP section must be prefixed by 'PPP/'. As an example, option 'minObs' from the PPP section of the BNC configuration file would be specified as 'PPP/minObs' on a command line.
</p>
<p>
Values for configuration options can be introduced via command line exactly as they show up in the configuration file. However, any value containing one or more blank characters must be enclosed by quotation marks when specified on command line.

'Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol' Version 1.0 (Ntrip) stands for an application-level protocol streaming Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data over the Internet. Ntrip is a generic, stateless protocol based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP/1.1. The HTTP objects are enhanced to GNSS data streams.
</p>

<p>
Ntrip Version 1 is an RTCM standard designed for disseminating differential correction data (e.g. in the RTCM-104 format) or other kinds of GNSS streaming data to stationary or mobile users over the Internet, allowing simultaneous PC, Laptop, PDA, or receiver connections to a broadcasting host. Ntrip supports wireless Internet access through Mobile IP Networks like GSM, GPRS, EDGE, or UMTS.
</p>

<p>
Ntrip is implemented in three system software components: Ntrip Clients, Ntrip Servers and Ntrip Broadcasters. The Ntrip Broadcaster is the actual HTTP server program whereas Ntrip Client and Ntrip Server are acting as HTTP clients.
</p>

<p>
Ntrip is an open none-proprietary protocol. Major characteristics of Ntrip's dissemination technique are:
<ul>
<li>Based on the popular HTTP streaming standard; comparatively easy to implement when having limited client and server platform resources available;</li>
<li>Application not limited to one particular plain or coded stream content; ability to distribute any kind of GNSS data;</li>
<li>Potential to support mass usage; disseminating hundreds of streams simultaneously for thousands of users possible when applying modified Internet Radio broadcasting software;</li>
<li>Considering security needs; stream providers and users don't necessarily get into contact, streams often not blocked by firewalls or proxy servers protecting Local Area Networks;</li>
<li>Enables streaming over mobile IP networks because of using TCP/IP.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Ntrip Broadcaster maintains a source-table containing information on available Ntrip streams, networks of Ntrip streams and Ntrip Broadcasters. The source-table is sent to an Ntrip Client on request. Source-table records are dedicated to one of the following: Data Streams (record type STR), Casters (record type CAS), or Networks of streams (record type NET).
</p>

<p>
Source-table records of type STR contain the following data fields: 'mountpoint', 'identifier', 'format', 'format-details', 'carrier', 'nav-system', 'network', 'country', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'nmea', 'solution', 'generator', 'compr-encryp', 'authentication', 'fee', 'bitrate', 'misc'.
</p>
<p>
Source-table records of type NET contain the following data fields: 'identifier', 'operator', 'authentication', 'fee', 'web-net', 'web-str', 'web-reg', 'misc'.
</p>
<p>
Source-table records of type CAS contain the following data fields: 'host', 'port', 'identifier', 'operator', 'nmea', 'country', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'misc'.
</p>

<p><h4>3.2.2 <a name="ntrip2">Ntrip Version 2</h4></p>

<p>
The major changes of Ntrip Version 2 compared to Version 1.0 are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Cleared and fixed design problems and HTTP protocol violations;</li>
<li>Replaced non standard directives;</li>
<li>Chunked transfer encoding;</li>
<li>Improvements in header records;</li>
<li>Source-table filtering;</li>
<li>RTSP communication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ntrip Version 2 allows to either communicate in TCP/IP mode or in RTSP/RTP mode or in UDP mode whereas Version 1 is limited to TCP/IP only. It furthermore allows using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols for secure Ntrip communication over the Internet.
</p>

<p><h4>3.2.3 <a name="rtcm2">RTCM Version 2</h4></p>
<p>
Transmitting GNSS carrier phase data can be done through RTCM Version 2 messages. Please note that only RTCM Version 2.2 and 2.3 streams may include GLONASS data. Messages that may be of interest here are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Type 1 message is the range correction message and is the primary message in code-phase differential positioning (DGPS). It is computed in the base receiver by computing the error in the range measurement for each tracked SV.
</li>
<li>
Type 2 message is automatically generated when a new set of satellite ephemeris is downloaded to the base receiver. It is the computed difference between the old ephemeris and the new ephemeris. Type 2 messages are used when the base station is transmitting Type 1 messages.
</li>
<li>
Type 3 and 22 messages are the base station position and the antenna offset. Type 3 and 22 are used in RTK processing to perform antenna reduction.
</li>
<li>
Type 6 message is a null frame filler message that is provided for data links that require continuous transmission of data, even if there are no corrections to send. As many Type 6 messages are sent as required to fill in the gap between two correction messages (type 1). Message 6 is not sent in burst mode.
</li>
<li>
Type 9 message serves the same purpose as Type 1, but does not require a complete satellite set. As a result, Type 9 messages require a more stable clock than a station transmitting Type 1 's, because the satellite corrections have different time references.
</li>
<li>
Type 16 message is simply a text message entered by the user that is transmitted from the base station to the rover. It is used with code-phase differential.
</li>
<li>
Type 18 and 20 messages are RTK uncorrected carrier phase data and carrier phase corrections.
</li>
<li>
Type 19 and 21 messages are the uncorrected pseudo-range measurements and pseudo-range corrections used in RTK.
</li>
<li>
Type 23 message provides the information on the antenna type used on the reference station.
</li>
<li>
Type 24 message carries the coordinates of the installed antenna's ARP in the GNSS coordinate system coordinates.
</li>
</ul>

<p><h4>3.2.4 <a name="rtcm3">RTCM Version 3</h4></p>
<p>
RTCM Version 3 has been developed as a more efficient alternative to RTCM Version 2. Service providers and vendors have asked for a standard that would be more efficient, easy to use, and more easily adaptable to new situations. The main complaint was that the Version 2 parity scheme was wasteful of bandwidth. Another complaint was that the parity is not independent from word to word. Still another was that even with so many bits devoted to parity, the actual integrity of the message was not as high as it should be. Plus, 30-bit words are awkward to handle. The Version 3 standard is intended to correct these weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
RTCM Version 3 defines a number of message types. Messages that may be of interest here are:
<ul>

<li>Type 1005, Station coordinates XYZ for antenna reference point.</li>
<li>Type 1006, Station coordinates XYZ for antenna reference point and antenna height.</li>
<li>Type 1007, Antenna descriptor and ID.</li>
<li>Type 1008, Antenna serial number.</li>
<li>Type 1009, GLONASS L1 code and phase.</li>
<li>Type 1010, GLONASS L1 code and phase and ambiguities and carrier-to-noise ratio.</li>
<li>Type 1011, GLONASS L1 and L2 code and phase.</li>
