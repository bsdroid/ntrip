BNS
=========================

BNC
=========================
(1) In case of problems with observation time stamps the progam outputs
"Wrong observation epoch(s)". When BNC is run in Windows mode and the problem
lasts for several minutes or more, the there is so much stuff to be printed
in BNC's graphic log window that the system crashes.

(2) BNC has a problem when the observation update rate is > 1Hz. Records get
mixed then in the RINEX files. A 10 Hz stream to test the situation is 
available from GFZ caster 139.17.3.112:4080 through stream A17H. An account for
accessing stream A17H is [bkgt:test].

(3) Wenn man beim Laden einer Sourcetable eine falsche nicht existierende 
Domain eingibt st√ºrzt BNC ab.

(4) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.
