BNS 
=========================
(*) Allow dummy clock values 999999.999999 as input?
Reason: DLR real-time engine (Oliver Montenbruck) uses dummies.
The general question behind this is: Could it be done that the
input for BNS(from RTNet) is more closely coming in SP3 format?
The differences to SP3 we have today are just the 999999.999999
and the 2i/3i integers for orbit and clock corrections.
However, this touches RTNet's output.

(*) How about clocks and orbits coming in sampling rates .ne. 1sec? 
Does it make sense to support i.e. 3sec/5sec/10sec?
Reason: DRL provides clocks and orbits with 30sec sampling.

DLR started to send SP3 stream to euref-ip.bkg.bund.de:7777.
BNS can't handle that because of 30sec sampling. DLR promised to switch
to 10sec within the next 2 months.

(*) "TODO: handle old ephemeris" in bns.cpp

BNC
=========================
(*) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.
Reason: Have seen 100% CPU. Dirk Stoecker says he has not seen
this over a period of several days. He also says the reason
could actually only be that the decoding function is called
although no new data available.
GW 08-09-15: BNC again shows 100% CPU because of PENC0.
Could it really be that the decoder is called although no new
data available? Deleted PENC0 from the configuration.

(*) Zdenek: Include GLONASS in RTCMv2 20/21 messages.

(*) Zdenek: Include Loss of Lock indicator in socket output for RTNet

(*) Let BNC read from files.

(*) Reconfigure BNC on-the-fly.
