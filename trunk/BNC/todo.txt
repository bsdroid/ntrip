Todo's sorted by priority:

BNS
=========================
(1) Reconnect of "Broadcast Ephemeris" stream upload to caster does not work.
    If we shut down the caster, wait a minute and then restart it, stream
    RTCM3EPH does not connect again.
(2) GLONASS-IOD 7-bit-Problem, explained by email from Andrea Stuerze.

BNC
=========================
(1) LM: Program crashes on Windows XP systems when saving stream contents in RINEX files.
(2) LM: Change time tag for GLONASS ephemeris from GPS time to GLONASS time (UTC).
(3) LM: We may also have a date problem in the GLONASS Ephemeris time tag.
    We once saw a wrong date.
(4) LM&JamesPerlt: Bandwidth graphics: one column per stream showing the current 
    bandwidth needed. Please consider this as "nice to have" - it's not a must.
    What we have is marked with "Begin new Perlt" and "End new Perlt" in bncwindow.cpp 
    and bncwindow.h. If you don't like it or if its to difficult to implement
    it then: please delete it form the source code.
(5) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.

RTNET
=========================
(1) SV missing in solution after temporary exclusion (e.g. SV not in IGU orbits or in SAT_2009.CRX), only on clock-ip
