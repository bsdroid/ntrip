Todo's sorted by priority:

BNC
=========================
(1) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.
Reason: Have seen 100% CPU. Dirk Stoecker says he has not seen
this over a period of several days. He also says the reason
could actually only be that the decoding function is called
although no new data available.
GW 08-09-15: BNC again shows 100% CPU because of PENC0.
Could it really be that the decoder is called although no new
data available? Deleted PENC0 from the configuration.

(2) ZL: Include GLONASS in RTCMv2 20/21 messages.

BNS 
=========================

(1) LM: "TODO: handle old ephemeris" in bns.cpp
