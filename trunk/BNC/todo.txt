(1) LM: Program crashes on Windows XP systems when saving stream contents in RINEX files.
(2) LM: Change time tag for GLONASS ephemeris from GPS time to GLONASS time (UTC).
(3) LM: We may also have a date problem in the GLONASS Ephemeris time tag.
    We once saw a wrong date.
(4) LM&JP: Bandwidth graphics: one column per stream showing the current bandwidth needed.
    Please consider this as "nice to have". It's of course not a must.
