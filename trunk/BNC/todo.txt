BNS
=========================
(1) Reconnect of "Broadcast Ephemeris" stream upload to caster does not work.
(2) GLONASS-IOD 7-bit-Problem, explained by email from Andrea Stuerze.

BNC
=========================
(1) LM: Program crashes on Windows XP systems when saving stream contents in RINEX files.
(2) LM: Change time tag for GLONASS ephemeris from GPS time to GLONASS time (UTC).
(3) LM: We may also have a date problem in the GLONASS Ephemeris time tag.
    We once saw a wrong date.
(4) LM&JP: Bandwidth graphics: one column per stream showing the current bandwidth needed.
    Please consider this as "nice to have". It's of course not a must.
(5) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.

RTNET
=========================
(1) SV missing in solution after temporary exclusion (e.g. SV not in IGU orbits or in SAT_2009.CRX), only on clock-ip
