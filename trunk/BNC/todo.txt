Todo's sorted by priority:

BNS
=========================
(1) Zero Clock Corrections
Loukis wishes to have one stream (for combination purposes)
which provides the original clocks from the BE (no corrections).
I remember that we once implemented a hard-coded option
for that in bns.cpp for Gerhard Wuebbena. I have added the solution
for Gerhard as comment lines to bns.cpp, see lines 385 ff.
To send zero clock corrections I have added options
"beClocks1" and "beClocks2" (for Broadcast Clocks) to BNS.


BNC & BNS & RTNet
=========================
(1) Update to new version of clock_orbit_rtcm.c
done in BNC and BNS. However, both run in
"OLD" mode, see  DEFINES += OLD in bnc.pro and bns.pro.
Main issue: Introduction of new messages for 
URA and high-rate clocks.


BNC
=========================
(1) If "<HTML><BODY>Requested data not found.</BODY></HTML>"
is received in addition to "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
when mounpoint is unavailable, this is not understood
as a NetworkError in bncnetqueryv2.

(2) NMEA "Auto" (send NMEA streams from rover to caster) not 
yet implemented.

(3) "Append files" options allways appends.

(4) Pure UDP protocol not yet implemented.

(5) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.
