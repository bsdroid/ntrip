Todo's sorted by priority:

BNC
=========================
(1) LM: Small memory leak in BNC, probably introduced through on-the-fly
configuration, becomes difficult when running BNC continuously over weeks/months.

(2) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.
Reason: Have seen 100% CPU. Dirk Stoecker says he has not seen
this over a period of several days. He also says the reason
could actually only be that the decoding function is called
although no new data available.
GW 08-09-15: BNC again shows 100% CPU because of PENC0.
Could it really be that the decoder is called although no new
data available? Deleted PENC0 from the configuration.

(3) ZL: Include GLONASS in RTCMv2 20/21 messages.

BNS 
=========================
(1) LM: Currently implementated 6 transformation parameters are:
Translations in X,Y,Z, and 
Rotation rates in X,Y,Z

Needs to be extended to 14 transformation parameters: 
Translations in X,Y,Z, and
Translation rates in X,Y,Z, and
Rotation in X,Z,Z, and
Rotation rates in X,Y,Z
Scale,
Scale rate

(2) LM: "TODO: handle old ephemeris" in bns.cpp
