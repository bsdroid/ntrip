Ntrip
-----
The ntripclient is an HTTP client based on 'Networked Transport
of RTCM via Internet Protocol' (Ntrip). This is an application-level 
protocol streaming Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data over 
the Internet. Ntrip is a generic, stateless protocol based on the 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP/1.1. The HTTP objects are enhanced 
to GNSS data streams.

Ntrip is designed for disseminating differential correction data 
(e.g in the RTCM-104 format) or other kinds of GNSS streaming data to
stationary or mobile users over the Internet, allowing simultaneous PC,
Laptop, PDA, or receiver connections to a broadcasting host. Ntrip 
supports Wireless Internet access through Mobile IP Networks like GSM, 
GPRS, EDGE, or UMTS.

Ntrip is implemented in three system software components: NtripClients, 
NtripServers and NtripCasters. The NtripCaster is the actual HTTP 
server program whereas NtripClient and NtripServer are acting as HTTP 
clients.

ntripclient
-----------
This POSIX Ntrip client program is written under GNU General Public 
License in C programming language. The program reads data from an Ntrip 
Broadcaster and writes on standard output for further redirection 
of data to a file or COM-port. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM VERSION
DOES NOT HANDLE POTENTIALLY OCCURRING INTERRUPTIONS OF COMMUNICATION
OR NETWORK CONGESTION SITUATIONS. Its distribution may stimulate
those intending to write their own client program.

Call the program with following arguments:

ntripclient -s server -u user ...
 -d --data      the requested data set
 -s --server    the server name or address
 -p --password  the login password
 -r --port      the server port number (default 2101)
 -u --user      the user name
 -n --nmea      NMEA string for sending to server
 -b --bitrate   output bitrate
 -S --proxyhost proxy name or address
 -R --proxyport proxy port, optional (default 2101)
 -M --mode      mode for data request
     Valid modes are:
     1, h, http     NTRIP Version 2.0 Caster in TCP/IP mode
     2, r, rtsp     NTRIP Version 2.0 Caster in RTSP/RTP mode
     3, n, ntrip1   NTRIP Version 1.0 Caster
     4, a, auto     automatic detection (default)

or using an URL:
ntripclient ntrip:data[/user[:password]][@[server][:port][@proxyhost[:proxyport]]][;nmea]

The argument '-h' will cause a HELP on the screen.
Without any argument ntripclient will provide the a table of
available resources (source table).

Compilation/Installation
------------------------
Please extract the archive and copy its contents into an appropriate
directory. Compile the source code under POSIX systems by calling 'make'.

Registration
------------
Some of the data streams (mountpoints) from an NtripCaster may be
available for test, demonstration, and evaluation purposes and
accessible without authentication/authorization. For accessing other
data streams (mountpoints) the user needs a user-ID and a
user password. Authorization can be provided for a single stream,
for a group of streams (network) or for all available streams.
Currently, registration can be requested via the registration form
on http://igs.bkg.bund.de/index_ntrip_reg.htm

Ntrip Broadaster Address and Port
---------------------------------
The current Internet address of the Ntrip Broadcaster is
www.euref-ip.net. The port number is 2101.

Disclaimer
----------
Note that this ntripclient program is for experimental use
only. The BKG disclaims any liability nor responsibility to any 
person or entity with respect to any loss or damage caused, or alleged 
to be caused, directly or indirectly by the use and application of the 
Ntrip technology.
