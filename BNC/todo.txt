BNS 
=========================
(*) Allow dummy clock values 999999.999999 coming from RTNet
Reason: DLR real-time engine (Oliver Montenbruck) uses dummies.

(*) How about clocks and orbits coming in sampling rates .ne. 1sec? 
Does it make sense to support i.e. 3sec/5sec/10sec?
Reason: DRL provides clocks and orbits with 30sec sampling.

(*) Outlier in orbit corrections concerning only GLONASS.
Comment from Georg: I don't have an idea where to look for the problem.
Does anybody have an idea for a test scenario?

(*) BNS reconnect behavior with respect to caster is sometimes a problem.
I checked the situation with breaking/re-establishing the Internet
connection. BNS just stops operation.

(*) BNS reconnect behavior with respect to BNC is sometimes a problem.
Reason: Once BNC is stopped and restarted, BNS does not continue
its operation.

BNC
=========================
(*) Georg: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.
Reason: Have seen 100% CPU. Dirk Stoecker says he has not seen
this over a period of several days. He also says the reason
could actually only be that the decoding function is called
although no new data available.

(*) Zdenek: Include GLONASS in RTCMv2 20/21 messages.

(*) Zdenek: Include Loss of Lock indicator in socket output for RTNet
Comment from Georg: Doesn't have this consequences for RTNet?

(*) Concerning the new RTCMv3 clock/orbit messages, it looks like
RTCM will now exchange input files between manufacturers. Each
Manufacturer will do the encoding and decoding and results will
be exchange to check them.
Leos: BNC can't read from files. Would it be possible to have an
additional function in BNC which allows that? (It may be, that
this is not easy to implement.) Input would be the full path
to the file plus a string describing the expected stream format.
