Todo's sorted by priority:

BNS
=========================
(1) Reconnect of "Broadcast Ephemeris" stream upload to caster does not work.
    If we shut down the caster, wait a minute and then restart it, stream
    RTCM3EPH does not reconnect.
(2) GLONASS-IOD 7-bit-Problem, explained by email from Andrea Stuerze.

BNC
=========================
(1) LM: Change time tag for GLONASS ephemeris from GPS time to GLONASS time (UTC).
(2) LM: We may also have a date problem in the GLONASS Ephemeris time tag.
    We once saw a wrong date.
(3) Ntrip version "U" (for UDP) works with Dirk Stoecker's caster at
    www.dgpsonline.eu:2101 but not with our own Caster at
    euref-ip.bkg.bund.de:2101. Check situation with mountPoints string:
    mountPoints=//bkg:realtime06@141.74.33.12:2101/ZOUF0 RTCM_2.3 46.56 12.97 no U,
               //weber:bkg@www.dgpsonline.eu:2101/WILD_RTK3 RTCM_3 52.36 13.56 no U
(4) LM&JamesPerlt: Bandwidth graphics: one column per stream showing the current 
    bandwidth needed. Please consider this as "nice to have" - it's not a must.
    What we have is marked with "Begin new Perlt" and "End new Perlt" in bncwindow.cpp 
    and bncwindow.h. If you don't like it or if its to difficult to implement
    it then: please delete it form the source code.
(5) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.

RTNET
=========================
(1) SV missing in solution after temporary exclusion (e.g. SV not in IGU orbits or in SAT_2009.CRX), only on clock-ip
