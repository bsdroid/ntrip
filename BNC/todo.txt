BNS
=========================
(1) One would expect that a new ephemeris set always comes with a later validity
time tag than a previously distributed ephemeris set. However, this is not always true.
Sometimes new ephemeris sets come with a validity time tag which is earlier than the
validity time tag of a previously distributed ephemeris set. This is something
we should consider in BNS. Gerhard observed that we dont consider this right
now. The consequence is that a satellite gets lost for PPP clients because
they deal with another ephemeris set than the correctors provided by
BNS.

BNC
=========================
(1) NMEA GGA string is not fully compatible with the standard.
The following are observations by Tamas Horvath: 
1. Time tag should refer to UTC time and not GPS system time.
2. Time tag format is hhmmss.ss and not hhmmss.
3. The GPS Quality indicator field is 1 (GPS SPS Mode), which is correct, as
there is no category for PPP. In my opinion the NMEA protocol should be
extended by a new indicator number for PPP to make a clear difference between
autonomous GNSS and PPP.
4. The HDOP value is constantly 2.0, which is obviously not real. I think this
field is filled with 2.0 as a default value in BNC.
5. The Age of Differential GPS data field is not populated. I believe here the
age of RTCM SSR data should be put.

(2) BNC has a problem when the observation update rate is > 1Hz. Records get
mixed then in the RINEX files. A 10 Hz stream to test the situation is 
available from GFZ caster 139.17.3.112:4080 through stream A17H.

(3) GW: Keep an eye on www.igs-ip.net/PENC0.
