\begin{description}
\item[1991] Prof. Gerhard Beutler became the director of the Astronomical Institute, University of
  Berne. The so-called Bernese GPS Software started to be used for (post-processing) analyzes of
  GNSS data.
\item[1992] LM started his PhD study at AIUB.
\item[1992] Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (consortium of AIUB, Swisstopo, BKG, IGN, and
  IAPG/TUM) established. Roughly at that time LM met Dr. Georg Weber for the first time.
\item[1993] International GPS Service formally recognized by the IAG.
\item[1994] IGS began providing GPS orbits and other products routinely (January, 1).
\item[1995] GPS declared fully operational.

\frametitle{CODE-Related Works in 1990's}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Bernese GPS Software was the primary tool for CODE analyzes (Fortran~77).
\item IGS reference network was sparse.
\item Real-time data transmission limited (Internet was still young, TCP/IP widely accepted 1989).
\item CPU power of then computers was limited (VAX/VMS OS used at AIUB).
\end{itemize}

In 1990's high precision GPS analyzes were almost exclusively performed in post-processing mode.
The typical precise application of GPS at that time was the processing of a network of static
GPS-only receivers for the estimation of station coordinates.
